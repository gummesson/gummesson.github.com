        <p>Yesterday while I was traveling a bit by train I read Paul Miller’s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/label/offline">offline series</a> on The Verge about his year without internet. Admittedly I’ve previously only skimmed through a couple of the articles, but I decided to catch up on all of them since I had some time to kill during my ride. I think it’s an intriguing idea yet at the same time a bit nightmarish. I mean, without an internet connection I wouldn’t even have read the articles. I think that a lot of people around my age can all relate to living their lives in some form or another through the internet and I’d probably be bored to death if I couldn’t use it at all. It might be sad, but it’s true nonetheless. The feeling of not being able to have an immediate access to instant information about pretty much anything would be more than overwhelming. I don’t know if I should feel bad about it either… Perhaps not, I guess?</p>

        <p>The iPhone/iPad version of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer</a> (which I use) got an update just in time for the release of iOS 6, and I’m really happy about the fact that it now finally has a Markdown preview mode. I was actually looking around for another app that had a function like that, but now I think I’m going to stick around with using it (even though <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">Drafts</a> looks good too).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-09-30-ia-writer-preview.png" alt="iA Writer - Preview Mode" /></p>

<p>I’m not that keen on how the text in the preview is formatted, but it’s no the end of the world because I don’t really use the app to write huge text pieces on my phone or anything like that. I think I’m good as long as I’m just using for capturing quick notes with ideas for blog posts and other writing related stuff.</p>

        <p>In the same vein as my recent RSS cleaning (mentioned in <a href="http://ellengummesson.com/blog/2012/09/17/cleaning-up/">this blog post</a> I’ve also started to declutter my computers from unneccassary apps, and I recently finally managed to achieve a inbox zero on my primary mail account (I’ve always been bad at it and I usually keep emails for way too long, but over the course of a couple of sessions I managed to get it under control by archiving a lot of emails and throwing away even more). But anways, back to the main topic of the post: decluttering your computer from stuff you don’t need. When I got my new computer at the start of August I realized that I actually didn’t need to install that many apps and that I mostly only had to install one per need. There are of course a few exceptions to that rule, like text editors for example, but those are often not that heavy on the system anyways.</p>

<p>Just before I started university I got a small <em>Samsung NC10</em> netbook as a gift. Even though it was far from a beast, it was a life saver during lectures and group projects. I’ve tried to keep it pretty clean and not having too many things on it, but I had to have a couple of heavier apps installed due to actually working on school projects on it. I also use it as my main machine when I was home during holidays. Now that I don’t have to use it for those to primary things I decided to really clean it up and use it only for browsing and the occasional writing session. I think I had about 85% of hard drive space left when I was done, and that’s including the OS. The boot time is actually quite minimal seeing as the computer is over three years old. I’m actually toying with the idea to use it more now, especially since I’m getting more more and more into writing long form posts, which I can thank the decluttering for. In that retrospect you could say that less really is more.</p>

<p><em>Another side note is that every app I have installed on this computer is free, which is quite awesome really. I think that I’ll write more on that particular subject later.</em></p>

        <p>I really doubt that anybody hasn’t seen the above website, but it still makes me laugh like a madman. The second largest city in Sweden (Gothenburg) no longer exists and I apparently live in my neighbor’s bushes, not in my actual house as I would expect.</p>

          </p>
        
        <p>A new version of <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter 1.4.0</a> was just released yesterday. Quite a lot has changed since in the app since I was previously using 1.3.6 since it was the latest stable release. This version feels like a big step up. The biggest changes in my opinion is that you now have the option to change the line spacing in your themes and that the save dialog won’t force you to either save your document as a .txt or a .rtf file, which is good news if you’re writing in Markdown like I do.</p>

<p>My favorite new feature is the focus mode. The focus mode lets you chose to focus on either one line, three lines or a paragraph by “blurring” out the rest of the text by changing it’s opacity (or something to that effect), which makes it blend in with the background and thus lets you focus on the the current focused text. This feature can also be found in iA Writer, which seems to be a constant inspiration for the development of FocusWriter by the way (I don’t see that as a bad thing though), although the former only lets you focus on one sentence at a time.</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-09-23-focuswriter-140.png" alt="Focus Mode in FocusWriter 1.4.0" /></p>

<p>There’s also a new function called Scenes, but I doubt I’ll use it that much since I personally don’t need it form my kind of writing. It essentially lets you create markers for different scenes in your document separating them by using a couple of characters. The default detection for a new scene is two hashes (which coincidentally is a second level heading in Markdown). I could see it being handy if I’m writing a really long blog post containing lots of headings though. FocusWriter is first and foremost made for writers, so there’s definitively a use for that type of thing. All in all I still think that FocusWriter is the best writing app I’ve come across.</p>
