  <p>My little <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> adventure continues and a couple of days ago I uninstalled <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>. I have nothing against it and I still think it’s a fantastic editor but I feel like I don’t really need it anymore. I’m no way near being a expert but like I’ve stated before I really like using Vim and I don’t see that that changing anytime soon. I’ve also configured my Vim files <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/vimfiles">quite a bit</a><sup id="fnref:20130124-1"><a href="#fn:20130124-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I’ve tried to stay away from adding too many plugins since I don’t want to rely on too many of them. Right now I use eight which I think is a reasonable number. I also finally re-did my git repository so that every plugin is a git submodule<sup id="fnref:20130123-2"><a href="#fn:20130123-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> which makes updating them much, much easier. I have to say that the customization possibilities in Vim are extraordinary. Who knew that that would be the case for an editor that’s just slightly younger than me?</p>

<h2 id="a-few-tips-and-tricks">A few tips and tricks</h2>

<p>I won’t go through my whole <code>vimrc</code> file since it’s currently about 225 lines long <em>(and heavily commented)</em> but I want to share a few handy settings.</p>

<p><strong>Set the language to english:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if has("unix")
  language messages C
else
  language messages en
endif  
</code></pre>

<p>I don’t know if I’m strange but I tend to stick with using english as my default language in nearly every app I install. I find it to be much easier googling for help. Since I both use Linux and Windows I had to add the <code>if...else...endif</code> part so that it plays nice with both of them<sup id="fnref:20130124-3"><a href="#fn:20130124-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It’s important to note that this needs to be at the very top of your <code>vimrc</code> file if you want it to work.</p>

<p><strong>Use the cursorline as a mode indicator:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au InsertEnter * set nocursorline
au InsertLeave * set cursorline
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted an easier way to quickly see which mode I was in without relying on some third party plugin. I of course have the <code>showmode</code> setting enabled but by removing the cursorline from insert mode I don’t even have to move my eyes one bit. I don’t really need to see which line I’m on anyway when I’m actually typing something.</p>

<p><strong>Autoresize all windows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au VimResized * :wincmd =
</code></pre>

<p>Resizing your windows in Vim can be a bit of a pain, especially if you want to go from using a fullscreen to something smaller or the other way around. The above setting makes it a lot less of a hassle.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore certain files:</strong></p>

<pre><code>set wildignore+=.git
</code></pre>

<p>This was one of the features that I like the most about Sublime Text 2 and I’m glad that I can use it in Vim too. If I can’t edit a certain filetype I don’t want to see it.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what’s been up with me lately but I do know that during the last couple of weeks I’ve “shipped” a lot of things. I mean, most of them are basic things but I’ve had fun while doing them. So yesterday I added yet another repo to <a href="https://github.com/gummesson">my GitHub account</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/serve">Serve</a>. <em>Serve</em> is a static site generator which focuses on generating small sites that only need to consist of a few pages at the most.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>It started with an faint idea. I wanted to build something useful that could parse a couple of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> files and convert them to static HTML files. It’s no secret that I absolutely adore <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but I tend to roll with an idea once I get it. I first threw together a one file script that had the same basic functionality and went from there. My goal was to really learn how to use modules and classes since I’ve mostly shied away from them<sup id="fnref:20130120-1"><a href="#fn:20130120-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I looked at a lot of different projects on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> but to be honest I couldn’t really comprehend everything, since I’m still pretty inexperienced when it comes to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and programming languages in general. I didn’t just want to give up though. I was going to finish my newly started projects goddamnit, even if it would take me months. </p>

<p>It suddenly clicked for me and I <em>finally</em> got “it”<sup id="fnref:20130120-2"><a href="#fn:20130120-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is such an amazing feeling. It didn’t take too long for me to transform the ugly script into it’s current state. I’m not saying it’s perfect but it looks a hell of a lot nicer then it did when I started and it sort of keeps me excited to continue to learn.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Learning stuff is awesome, especially when you notice your own progress.</p>

      <p>With “it” I mean how to use them to get them to work with the rest of the code. “Inheritance!” was literally the thing that popped up in my head that made me understand everything. It’s funny how the brain works sometimes.<a href="#fnref:20130120-2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>My experiments with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> framework continues and yesterday I pushed yet another app to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> called <a href="http://slugize.ellengummesson.com/">Slugize</a>. It only has one small purpose: creating a slug out of a blog title, which can be pretty handy when you use a static site generator like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I usually don’t decide on a title until a few seconds before I “hit publish” which means that fixing the slug is usually the last thing I do. I find it extremely annoying that I have to manually type out <code>-</code> between every word in the title and change every letter to be in downcase<sup id="fnref:20130115-1"><a href="#fn:20130115-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I guess you can call it lazyiness too. Now I only need to copy and paste the title into <em>Slugize</em> and it’ll do it automatically for me and I also added an option to append the current day’s date to it. It’s funny how being lazy sometimes makes you more productive.</p>

  <p>Yesterday I finally pushed something to the master branch of a thing I started working on last week, <a href="#">Smallwork</a>. It’s a small yet full featured <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SCSS</a> framework, or starting point as I’d like to call it. The first time I tried SCSS was way back in August or September but I didn’t really “get” it until I started learning Ruby. The code length measures in at a total of 1156 numbers of lines<sup id="fnref:20130112-1"><a href="#fn:20130112-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which kind of makes it my most ambitious work to date.</p>

<p>I also played around with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> again and came up with a simple journal app which uses <a href="http://datamapper.org/">Datamapper</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite3</a> for storing everything in a database. Like I mentioned earlier I’m quite fond of Sinatra, especially since it’s really easy to understand what do to and what’s going on. The code is so self-explanatory that I sometimes have to pinch myself to see that I’m not in fact dreaming. I’m no expert but I like where I’m going with it and I’ve barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about extending <a href="http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/">Kramit!</a> a bit, but we’ll see how that goes… I guess I should try to slow myself down a bit since I’ve launched three new projects this week alone. I’m having fun though!</p>

<div class="footnotes">

      <p>That’s including blank lines and comments. It’s still a pretty big number though. The compiled CSS code is 682 lines long and that’s without any additional content besides the basic structure itself.<a href="#fnref:20130112-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
