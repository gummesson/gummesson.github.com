  <p>A couple of days ago my new hard drive that I bought a mere three weeks ago decided that it was time to make my life not so fun by giving up. For some reason it failed, and it failed hard. Luckily, I had all of my important files (like this whole site) stored on an external drive and I have a SSD where I can keep my OS and all of my programs and such, but some of my other files are forever lost. It sucks, but I’ll survive. My brother (who really helped med out) fought like a champ trying to get it to work, but it was a lost cause. In the process of trying to save my new hard drive I also had to wipe my SSD too. It took quite a while to install everything again, but now it’s all up and running. The “failed to sync branch” problem I had earlier with GitHub is also gone, which I guess you could say is good, even though I would’ve rather had that problem than going trough this whole ordeal. </p>

<p>I don’t really know if I’m more sad or more angry though. Sure, it’s really important that you take backups of everything that you want to keep and store, but I don’t think I really can blame myself entirely in this case. I mean, you don’t really except a hard drive that you’ve barely used to break down and just fail on you so suddenly. On the other hand I do want to kick myself in the head, atleast just a little bit. Oh well. Sometimes we think that computers are these indestructible things that can do no wrong, but I guess that’s not really the case. Now I’m keeping my fingers crossed that I can get it replaced without any hassles, but that shouldn’t really be a problem. I hope.</p>

  <p>Now that I’ve had this blog for a while I thought it would be a good idea to write about how my so called workflow looks to wrap this whole Jekyll series up.</p>

<h2 id="writing-in-markdownpad">1. Writing in MarkdownPad</h2>

<p>I first fire up <a href="http://www.markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a> and start writing a new blog post. It’s a really nifty little tool for us Mac-depraved Windows users. I use DejaVu Sans Mono (which is my choice for coding purposes too) as my default font with <code>#FF434343</code> as the font color and <code>#FFF2F2F2</code> as the background color.</p>

<h2 id="running-jekyll-locally">2. Running Jekyll locally</h2>

<p>After I’m done with my writing, I fire up the command line and run Jekyll to generate my site. I also skim through my blog post to make sure that I haven’t accidentally made a typo or something to that effect.</p>

<h2 id="pushing-to-github">3. Pushing to GitHub</h2>

<p>Last but not least, I open up <a href="http://windows.github.com/" title="GitHub for Windows">GitHub for Windows</a> and push my site to GitHub. Even though it’s not the most convenient thing to do it’s still pretty easy and it makes the transfer so much faster with no hassles.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> GitHub Pages (where I host my site) can actually run Jekyll and generate your site automatically but you can’t use your own plugins, so that’s why I’m deploying my static pages rather than just the source itself.</p>

<p>And that’s it! You could argue that it sounds a lot like overkill, but it works for me. Sure, I can’t upgrade something without sitting infront of my computer, but I know that I’d never update from a phone or email anyways. It really makes me think twice before I publish something too, which I like.</p>

  <p>Being bored sometimes has it’s own perks. I continued experimenting with the <a href="/projects/begrider/">Begrider</a> project and ended up adding a couple of more things to it, mainly a new set of column-like classes called <code>.unit-</code>. A unit differ itself from a regular column by not having a gutter, and thus having more of a “proportional” percentage width. So, instead of just having these:</p>

<pre><code>.row .column-twelve {
  width: 99.99%;
  margin-right: 0;
}

.row .column-eleven {
  width: 91.42%;
}

.row .column-ten {
  width: 82.85%;
}

/* Nine columns */
.row .column-nine {
  width: 74.28%;
}

.row .column-eight {
  width: 65.71%;
}

.row .column-seven {
  width: 57.14%;
}

.row .column-six {
  width: 48.57%;
}

.row .column-five {
  width: 40%;
}

.row .column-four {
  width: 31.43%;
}

.row .column-three {
  width: 22.86%;
}

.row .column-two {
  width: 14.29%;
}

.row .column-one {
  width: 5.72%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use these:</p>

<pre><code>.row .unit-full {
  width: 100%;
}

.row .unit-four-fifths {
  width: 80%;
}

.row .unit-three-quarters {
  width: 75%;
}

.row .unit-two-thirds {
  width: 66.66%;
}

.row .unit-three-fifths {
  width: 60%;
}

.row .unit-half {
  width: 50%;
}

.row .unit-two-fifths {
  width: 40%;
}

.row .unit-one-third {
  width: 33.33%;
}

.row .unit-one-quarter {
  width: 25%;
}

.row .unit-one-fifth {
  width: 20%;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It’s useful if you don’t want to have any gutters and/or want to use paddings instead instead of margins. I don’t know if anyone’s ever going to use besides myself, but I quite like to work on it either way. Like I said, it keeps my boredom at bay. I don’t really know if it actually needs anything more, but I’ll be sure to try stuff out.</p>

  <p>As some of you may know, I’ve built my own grid system with the world’s most horrible name, <a href="/projects/begrider/" title="Begrider is a simple, twelve column 1140px fluid grid system">Begrider</a>. One thing that always bothered me with it was that at when you wanted to the row to end you’d had to add a class named <code>.last</code>.  I added this because it was a simple solution to my problem. I’ve experimented with adding negative margins, but I never got it to function properly. Yesterday I found the perfect solution for my needs. </p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>Begrider uses an attribute selector to target all of the column classes rather than adding all the properties and values to them by hand or having to declare all of the classes twice. So I did some experimenting and for some reason tried this simple trick:</p>

<pre><code>[class^="col-"]:last-child {
  margin-right: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It worked! I know that I always sound suprised when something I’ve done works, but this really took me by suprise. Now the last <code>.col</code> in the row gets it’s gutter/margin removed without adding another class to it. I ran it through Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer 9 and it works in all of them. However, it should be noted that while IE9 supports it, IE8 don’t (IE8 isn’t too fond of the :last-child thing). I think I’m going to leave the <code>.last</code> class in the code, just so there’s an option to use it. </p>

<p>I also re-did some parts in Begrider and split it up to two different versions: one called begrider-new and another called begrider-old. The new version uses attribute selectors to apply properties and values on all of column classes and to remove the gutter from the last column in the row. The second one groups the column classes together to add their shared properties and values while seperating them for their unique width property.</p>

  <p>Okay, I wouldn’t really call it my first real plugin, but I took the <a href="http://www.portwaypoint.co.uk/jekyll-youtube-liquid-template-tag-gist/" title="Jekyll Youtube Liquid Template Tag Gist">Youtube plugin</a> I use and modified it so you can embed videos from Vimeo with a simple Liquid tag. That’s usually the way I learn stuff anyways (even though I haven’t really wrapped my head around Ruby yet) so I figured that it’d be interesting to see if I could make it work even though my modifications weren’t that significant. Maybe I’ll pick it up some day.</p>

<pre><code>module Jekyll
  class Vimeo &lt; Liquid::Tag
    @@width = 500
    @@height = 281

    def initialize(name, id, tokens)
      super
