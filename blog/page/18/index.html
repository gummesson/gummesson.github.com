            Posted on October  7, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Writing" alt="Writing">Writing</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Markdown" alt="Markdown">Markdown</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Plain Text" alt="Plain Text">Plain Text</a>  
          </p>
        
        <p>When I first heard about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> a couple of month ago it sparked my interest. I’ve never really felt comfortable writing in a word processor nor in a WYSIWYG editor, so using something that would make it possible to write in any text editor while maintaining a kind of form of formatting sounded like a perfect solution that would really benefit my needs. It was originally created <em>“to be used as a format for writing for the web”</em>, ie. an easier way to convert plain text with a simple formatting to HTML. I won’t go in to further detail one why I think it’s great, but if you need more convincing or just want to read some more on this particular subject I suggest that you scroll down to the bottom of this blog post and read a couple of links I’ve collected about Markdown and plain text. Trust me, it’s worth it!</p>

<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>

<p>The formatting of the syntax is really, really simple to remember. I honestly don’t even think about anymore it when I write since it’s become like second nature to me. If you want to get a closer look of the whole syntax I suggest that you go to the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>

<pre><code># Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
</code></pre>

<p>A hashtag represents a heading, where each hashtag equals to the size of the heading, ie. a first level heading becomes a <code>h1</code> tag and so on when it’s converted to HTML.</p>

<h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3>

<pre><code>*Bold* 
**Italic**
***Bold and italic***
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You can also use <code>_</code> instead of <code>*</code> too.</p>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<pre><code>[Click Here](http://www.example.com/ "Example.com") 

[Click Here][example]
[example]: http://www.example.com/ "Example.com"

&lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There’s three ways to create a link. The rule of thumb is that the word you want to make clickable goes in to <code>[]</code> while the actual URL and title tag goes in between <code>()</code>. You can also use <code>&lt;&gt;</code> if you just want to make an URL clickable.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> The second example is useful when you don’t want to clutter your text with the URL and the title.</p>

<h3 id="unordered-lists">Unordered lists</h3>

<pre><code>- One 
- Two
- Three
- Four
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You can also use <code>*</code> or <code>+</code> when you’re dealing with an unordered list.</p>

<h3 id="ordered-lists">Ordered lists</h3>

<pre><code>1. One 
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You don’t actually have to numerically order your list if you’re going to export it to HTML, but I don’t really see the point of not doing that.</p>

<h3 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h3>

<pre><code>&gt; Lorem ipsum...
</code></pre>

<p><em>Side note:</em> Even if your quote is longer than a single line you only really have to use a <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of the quote.</p>

<h3 id="images">Images</h3>

<pre><code>![Alt Text](http://www.example.com/images/picture.jpg "Title Text")
</code></pre>

<p>Adding an image is really similar to adding a link. This may be the most “inconvenient” feature of the syntax since you have no real control over the image’s width and height, but that shouldn’t be a problem if you size it the way you want it beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<pre><code>`.inline-code` 

    .code-block {
      color: #000;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You have to indent the code with four spaces or a tab to create a code block.</p>

<h2 id="editors">Editors</h2>

<p>Basically any text editor will do since Markdown is just really plain text, but that may not be the most optimal thing (I’m a sucker for a good interface). While there’s a plethora of markdown-friendly text editors for iOS and OSX there’s not a lot of them for Windows. I personally use <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/">FocusWriter</a> (which doesn’t really support Markdown) and <a href="http://www.markdownpad.com/">MarkdownPad</a> and  I’ve played around with <a href="http://writemonkey.com/">WriteMonkey</a> and <a href="http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/">Markpad</a>. I’ve also stumbled across <a href="http://www.mdcharm.com/">mdCharm</a> and <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute">Qute</a> but I haven’t tried them out.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier, FocusWriter doesn’t have support for Markdown but the beauty of the syntax is that it’s pretty damn readable even without highlighting. I really like the focus mode in it too and it’s cross plattform, meaning that I can use it on any OS that I want to. MarkdownPad was the first markdown editor I used so it has a special place in my heart, as lame as  that might sound. In short, I use FocusWriter for when I write longer pieces of text while I fire up MarkdownPad for shorter things and format checking. This might seem like overkill, but I like to have the opportunity to once in a while use a preview while I’m typing something out. </p>

<p>I do think that WriteMonkey looks good too, but I’m not too fond of the idea of relying exclusively on keyboard shortcuts. I would probably like mdCharm too, especially since it has a syntax highlightning and the ability to export the Markdown files straight to PDF, which is something MarkdownPad lacks. I might try to use them more extensively at some point.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>If you’re looking for a way to start intergrating plain text into your workflow, Markdown is the way to go. The formatting syntax is simple and you’re never going to be tied down to one specific tool for your writing. All in all, it’s easy to use and it’s future proof.</p>

        <p>Yesterday while I was traveling a bit by train I read Paul Miller’s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/label/offline">offline series</a> on The Verge about his year without internet. Admittedly I’ve previously only skimmed through a couple of the articles, but I decided to catch up on all of them since I had some time to kill during my ride. I think it’s an intriguing idea yet at the same time a bit nightmarish. I mean, without an internet connection I wouldn’t even have read the articles. I think that a lot of people around my age can all relate to living their lives in some form or another through the internet and I’d probably be bored to death if I couldn’t use it at all. It might be sad, but it’s true nonetheless. The feeling of not being able to have an immediate access to instant information about pretty much anything would be more than overwhelming. I don’t know if I should feel bad about it either… Perhaps not, I guess?</p>

        <p>The iPhone/iPad version of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8">iA Writer</a> (which I use) got an update just in time for the release of iOS 6, and I’m really happy about the fact that it now finally has a Markdown preview mode. I was actually looking around for another app that had a function like that, but now I think I’m going to stick around with using it (even though <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8">Drafts</a> looks good too).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-09-30-ia-writer-preview.png" alt="iA Writer - Preview Mode" /></p>

<p>I’m not that keen on how the text in the preview is formatted, but it’s no the end of the world because I don’t really use the app to write huge text pieces on my phone or anything like that. I think I’m good as long as I’m just using for capturing quick notes with ideas for blog posts and other writing related stuff.</p>

          </p>
        
        <p>In the same vein as my recent RSS cleaning (mentioned in <a href="http://ellengummesson.com/blog/2012/09/17/cleaning-up/">this blog post</a> I’ve also started to declutter my computers from unneccassary apps, and I recently finally managed to achieve a inbox zero on my primary mail account (I’ve always been bad at it and I usually keep emails for way too long, but over the course of a couple of sessions I managed to get it under control by archiving a lot of emails and throwing away even more). But anways, back to the main topic of the post: decluttering your computer from stuff you don’t need. When I got my new computer at the start of August I realized that I actually didn’t need to install that many apps and that I mostly only had to install one per need. There are of course a few exceptions to that rule, like text editors for example, but those are often not that heavy on the system anyways.</p>

<p>Just before I started university I got a small <em>Samsung NC10</em> netbook as a gift. Even though it was far from a beast, it was a life saver during lectures and group projects. I’ve tried to keep it pretty clean and not having too many things on it, but I had to have a couple of heavier apps installed due to actually working on school projects on it. I also use it as my main machine when I was home during holidays. Now that I don’t have to use it for those to primary things I decided to really clean it up and use it only for browsing and the occasional writing session. I think I had about 85% of hard drive space left when I was done, and that’s including the OS. The boot time is actually quite minimal seeing as the computer is over three years old. I’m actually toying with the idea to use it more now, especially since I’m getting more more and more into writing long form posts, which I can thank the decluttering for. In that retrospect you could say that less really is more.</p>

<p><em>Another side note is that every app I have installed on this computer is free, which is quite awesome really. I think that I’ll write more on that particular subject later.</em></p>
