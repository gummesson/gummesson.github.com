  <p>Today I decided to hack together a small plugin for Jekyll that can count all the words in a blog post and also roughly calculate how many seconds it takes to read it. This is based on some quick googling where I found out that the average person reads 300 words per minute, so I’m not sure if it’s 100% true but it’s a pretty fun feature nonetheless. I’ve of course created a repository for it on <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-wordcount">GitHub</a>. I’m not entirely sure that the implementation I use is the best since it needs to read the content and strip it of it’s HTML tags before actually doing the counting but it was by far the easiest way<sup id="fnref:20130131-1"><a href="#fn:20130131-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The couting seems to be quite accurate too, which is nice.</p>

    </p><!-- .smallprint -->
  
  <p>One of the biggest advantages of using a dedicated tool for writing <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is that they often come with some way of previewing your text file. I kind of miss that kind of function when I’m using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> I decided to throw together a simple vimscript that uses <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/">Pandoc</a> to convert a Markdown file to HTML. The basic gist of it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function! PandocMarkdownPreview()
  silent exec 'cd %:p:h'
  silent exec 'pwd'
  silent exec '!pandoc -o preview.html %'
endfunction
</code></pre>

<p>It sets the directory of the current open file as the root and then calls Pandoc to do the conversion. It’s not that terribly complicated but it gets the job done well. I also expanded upon it a bit and added another part that’ll open the <code>preview.html</code> directly in the browser:</p>

<pre><code>if has("win32")
  silent exec '!start cmd /c preview.html'
else
  silent exec '!xdg-open preview.html'
endif
</code></pre>

<p>One thing that’s worth being mentioned is that the <code>!xdg-open</code> part can be changed to <code>!open</code> and then you can also use it if you’re on a Mac.</p>

<p>In the end the whole thing looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function! PandocMarkdownPreview()
  silent exec 'cd %:p:h'
  silent exec 'pwd'
  silent exec '!pandoc -o preview.html %'
  if has("win32")
    silent exec '!start cmd /c preview.html'
  else
    silent exec '!xdg-open preview.html'
  endif
endfunction
</code></pre>

<p>And the mapping looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>map &lt;leader&gt;pmd :call PandocMarkdownPreview()&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also threw together more refined version of the whole thing in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/4649514">gist on Github</a>. You’ll obviously need to have Pandoc install on your machine in order to get it up and running.</p>

  <p>My little <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> adventure continues and a couple of days ago I uninstalled <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>. I have nothing against it and I still think it’s a fantastic editor but I feel like I don’t really need it anymore. I’m no way near being a expert but like I’ve stated before I really like using Vim and I don’t see that that changing anytime soon. I’ve also configured my Vim files <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/vimfiles">quite a bit</a><sup id="fnref:20130124-1"><a href="#fn:20130124-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I’ve tried to stay away from adding too many plugins since I don’t want to rely on too many of them. Right now I use eight which I think is a reasonable number. I also finally re-did my git repository so that every plugin is a git submodule<sup id="fnref:20130123-2"><a href="#fn:20130123-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> which makes updating them much, much easier. I have to say that the customization possibilities in Vim are extraordinary. Who knew that that would be the case for an editor that’s just slightly younger than me?</p>

<h2 id="a-few-tips-and-tricks">A few tips and tricks</h2>

<p>I won’t go through my whole <code>vimrc</code> file since it’s currently about 225 lines long <em>(and heavily commented)</em> but I want to share a few handy settings.</p>

<p><strong>Set the language to english:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if has("unix")
  language messages C
else
  language messages en
endif  
</code></pre>

<p>I don’t know if I’m strange but I tend to stick with using english as my default language in nearly every app I install. I find it to be much easier googling for help. Since I both use Linux and Windows I had to add the <code>if...else...endif</code> part so that it plays nice with both of them<sup id="fnref:20130124-3"><a href="#fn:20130124-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It’s important to note that this needs to be at the very top of your <code>vimrc</code> file if you want it to work.</p>

<p><strong>Use the cursorline as a mode indicator:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au InsertEnter * set nocursorline
au InsertLeave * set cursorline
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted an easier way to quickly see which mode I was in without relying on some third party plugin. I of course have the <code>showmode</code> setting enabled but by removing the cursorline from insert mode I don’t even have to move my eyes one bit. I don’t really need to see which line I’m on anyway when I’m actually typing something.</p>

<p><strong>Autoresize all windows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au VimResized * :wincmd =
</code></pre>

<p>Resizing your windows in Vim can be a bit of a pain, especially if you want to go from using a fullscreen to something smaller or the other way around. The above setting makes it a lot less of a hassle.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore certain files:</strong></p>

<pre><code>set wildignore+=.git
</code></pre>

<p>This was one of the features that I like the most about Sublime Text 2 and I’m glad that I can use it in Vim too. If I can’t edit a certain filetype I don’t want to see it.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what’s been up with me lately but I do know that during the last couple of weeks I’ve “shipped” a lot of things. I mean, most of them are basic things but I’ve had fun while doing them. So yesterday I added yet another repo to <a href="https://github.com/gummesson">my GitHub account</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/serve">Serve</a>. <em>Serve</em> is a static site generator which focuses on generating small sites that only need to consist of a few pages at the most.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>It started with an faint idea. I wanted to build something useful that could parse a couple of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> files and convert them to static HTML files. It’s no secret that I absolutely adore <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, but I tend to roll with an idea once I get it. I first threw together a one file script that had the same basic functionality and went from there. My goal was to really learn how to use modules and classes since I’ve mostly shied away from them<sup id="fnref:20130120-1"><a href="#fn:20130120-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I looked at a lot of different projects on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> but to be honest I couldn’t really comprehend everything, since I’m still pretty inexperienced when it comes to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> and programming languages in general. I didn’t just want to give up though. I was going to finish my newly started projects goddamnit, even if it would take me months. </p>

<p>It suddenly clicked for me and I <em>finally</em> got “it”<sup id="fnref:20130120-2"><a href="#fn:20130120-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is such an amazing feeling. It didn’t take too long for me to transform the ugly script into it’s current state. I’m not saying it’s perfect but it looks a hell of a lot nicer then it did when I started and it sort of keeps me excited to continue to learn.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Learning stuff is awesome, especially when you notice your own progress.</p>

    </li>
    <li id="fn:20130120-2">
      <p>With “it” I mean how to use them to get them to work with the rest of the code. “Inheritance!” was literally the thing that popped up in my head that made me understand everything. It’s funny how the brain works sometimes.<a href="#fnref:20130120-2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
