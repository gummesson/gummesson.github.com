    <p class="post-meta small-margin">Posted on October 16, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Tech" alt="Tech" title="Tech" class="no-border">Tech</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Apps" alt="Apps" title="Apps" class="no-border">Apps</a>  </p>
  
    <p>I hate having a clouded desktop (it never looks good in my opinion) but I like to be able to open apps and documents really fast. As soon as an idea pops into my head I want to have the opportunity to write it down (or whatever I need to do) and run with it, so to speak. I've tried a minimal approach by just using the built-in search function in Windows 7 which is located in the start menu. It works okay for finding apps and such but the indexing of documents is horrendous to say the least. You can't really add and choose what you want to include either. While looking for a worthy alternative to it I found <a href="http://www.launchy.net/" title="Launchy">Launchy</a>.</p>

<p><img src='/images/blog/2012-10-16-launchy.png' title='Launchy' alt='Launchy'></p>

<p>Launchy is an open source, cross platform (which means that it's right up my alley) utility application similiar to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2531" title="Mac 101: Spotlight">Spotlight</a>, <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/" title="Alfred">Alfred</a> and <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html" title="LaunchBar">LaunchBar</a> for OS X. I've now used it for about a week or so and I can already tell that's it's going to be added to my essential apps list. It's fast, you can include and exclude anything you want, search the web, do simple math calculations and also change it's appearance (I use the <a href="http://artblanc.deviantart.com/art/Loupe-for-Launchy-264482213" title="Loupe for Launchy">Loupe</a> skin). It'll also learn what you mean when you search for something, which meaning that Launchy will list the thing that you use the most when you type in something that corresponds with the filename. An example for that is that when I search for the folder where I have my website, which is suprisingly called "Jekyll", I only have to hit a simple "j" on my keyboard for it to pick up that I mean that particular folder. It's awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><br/>
There's a lot of skins available on <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/skins/applaunchers/launchy/" title="Launchy Skins on DeviantART">DeviantART</a>, go check them out if you're looking for some nice alternatives.</p>

    <p class="post-meta small-margin">Posted on October 13, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Productivity" alt="Productivity" title="Productivity" class="no-border">Productivity</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Apps" alt="Apps" title="Apps" class="no-border">Apps</a>  </p>
  
    <p>During the last couple of years I've tried a lot of todo apps and techniques. I've used pen and paper, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a>, a regular calendar, whatever default app my phone came with, using my own memory, <a href="http://www.any.do/" title="Any.DO">Any.DO</a>, <a href="https://cheddarapp.com/" title="Cheddar">Cheddar</a>, post-it notes and so on. While they've certainly done their job and some of them have been stunningly beautiful I've never felt they were quite right for me. At first I couldn't really pinpoint what I felt was wrong with them all, but after I've started to use plain text for nearly everything I do I can now say that it all boils down to two things: portability and easy editing. Since I came to realize this I've ditched all the fancy todo apps I previously used and tried out for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?mt=8" title="todo.txt Touch">todo.txt Touch</a> and <a href="http://benrhughes.com/todotxt.net/" title="todotxt.net">todotxt.net</a> with the simple default <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format" title="The Todo.txt Format">formatting</a> for the official project.</p>

<p>Storing your todo list in a plain text file is, like <a href="/blog/2012/10/07/the-one-about-markdown/" title="The One About Markdown">I've stated earlier</a>, future proof as long as I have a simple text editor installed, which means that I can edit them on any practically any computer or modern device. That's something that not every todo app can do which can be frustrating since you're often restricted to primarily one device. Obviously there's cross platform todo apps too, but I've found that that they still feel too restrictive for me. A thing that's great about using a plain text todo file is that you never have to rely to heavily on someone else's database for storage, which ties in with the whole portability mentality. I do have my todo.txt on my Dropbox account but I can still access it even if I'm offline and more importantly, it's still just a plain text file. I do really like a good and innovative interface but in this case I think that the simplest approach is the best approach, atleast for me.</p>

    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/10/07/the-one-about-markdown" alt="The One About Markdown" title="The One About Markdown" class="no-border">The One About Markdown</a></h1>
    <p class="post-meta small-margin">Posted on October  7, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Web" alt="Web" title="Web" class="no-border">Web</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Writing" alt="Writing" title="Writing" class="no-border">Writing</a>  </p>
  
    <p>When I first heard about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> a couple of month ago it sparked my interest. I've never really felt comfortable writing in a word processor nor in a WYSIWYG editor, so using something that would make it possible to write in any text editor while maintaining a kind of form of formatting sounded like a perfect solution that would really benefit my needs. It was originally created <em>"to be used as a format for writing for the web"</em>, ie. an easier way to convert plain text with a simple formatting to HTML. I won't go in to further detail one why I think it's great, but if you need more convincing or just want to read some more on this particular subject I suggest that you scroll down to the bottom of this blog post and read a couple of links I've collected about Markdown and plain text. Trust me, it's worth it!</p>

<h2>Formatting</h2>

<p>The formatting of the syntax is really, really simple to remember. I honestly don't even think about anymore it when I write since it's become like second nature to me. If you want to get a closer look of the whole syntax I suggest that you go to the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown Syntax">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>Headings</h3>

<pre><code># Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
</code></pre>

<p>A hashtag represents a heading, where each hashtag equals to the size of the heading, ie. a first level heading becomes a <code>h1</code> tag and so on when it's converted to HTML.</p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>

<pre><code>*Bold* 
**Italic**
***Bold and italic***
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You can also use <code>_</code> instead of <code>*</code> too.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<pre><code>[Click Here](http://www.example.com/ "Example.com") 

[Click Here][example]
[example]: http://www.example.com/ "Example.com"

&lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There's three ways to create a link. The rule of thumb is that the word you want to make clickable goes in to <code>[]</code> while the actual URL and title tag goes in between <code>()</code>. You can also use <code>&lt;&gt;</code> if you just want to make an URL clickable.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> The second example is useful when you don't want to clutter your text with the URL and the title.</p>

<h3>Unordered lists</h3>

<pre><code>- One 
- Two
- Three
- Four
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You can also use <code>*</code> or <code>+</code> when you're dealing with an unordered list.</p>

<h3>Ordered lists</h3>

<pre><code>1. One 
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You don't actually have to numerically order your list if you're going to export it to HTML, but I don't really see the point of not doing that.</p>

<h3>Blockquotes</h3>

<pre><code>&gt; Lorem ipsum...
</code></pre>

<p><em>Side note:</em> Even if your quote is longer than a single line you only really have to use a <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of the quote.</p>

<h3>Images</h3>

<pre><code>![Alt Text](http://www.example.com/images/picture.jpg "Title Text")
</code></pre>

<p>Adding an image is really similar to adding a link. This may be the most "inconvenient" feature of the syntax since you have no real control over the image's width and height, but that shouldn't be a problem if you size it the way you want it beforehand.</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<pre><code>`.inline-code` 

    .code-block {
      color: #000;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You have to indent the code with four spaces or a tab to create a code block.</p>

<h2>Editors</h2>

<p>Basically any text editor will do since Markdown is just really plain text, but that may not be the most optimal thing (I'm a sucker for a good interface). While there's a plethora of markdown-friendly text editors for iOS and OSX there's not a lot of them for Windows. I personally use <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/" title="FocusWriter">FocusWriter</a> (which doesn't really support Markdown) and <a href="http://www.markdownpad.com/" title="MarkdownPad">MarkdownPad</a> and  I've played around with <a href="http://writemonkey.com/" title="WriteMonkey">WriteMonkey</a> and <a href="http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/" title="Markpad">Markpad</a>. I've also stumbled across <a href="http://www.mdcharm.com/" title="mdCharm">mdCharm</a> and <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute" title="Qute">Qute</a> but I haven't tried them out.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier, FocusWriter doesn't have support for Markdown but the beauty of the syntax is that it's pretty damn readable even without highlighting. I really like the focus mode in it too and it's cross plattform, meaning that I can use it on any OS that I want to. MarkdownPad was the first markdown editor I used so it has a special place in my heart, as lame as  that might sound. In short, I use FocusWriter for when I write longer pieces of text while I fire up MarkdownPad for shorter things and format checking. This might seem like overkill, but I like to have the opportunity to once in a while use a preview while I'm typing something out.</p>

<p>I do think that WriteMonkey looks good too, but I'm not too fond of the idea of relying exclusively on keyboard shortcuts. I would probably like mdCharm too, especially since it has a syntax highlightning and the ability to export the Markdown files straight to PDF, which is something MarkdownPad lacks. I might try to use them more extensively at some point.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>If you're looking for a way to start intergrating plain text into your workflow, Markdown is the way to go. The formatting syntax is simple and you're never going to be tied down to one specific tool for your writing. All in all, it's easy to use and it's future proof.</p>
