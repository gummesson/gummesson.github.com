    <span class="justified">
      <p>Here&rsquo;s a list of what I consider awesome apps and utilities for Windows. Even though there&rsquo;s no shortage of them I sometimes find that it&rsquo;s quite hard to find those gems that really stand out.</p>

<h2 id="focuswriter">FocusWriter</h2>

<p><a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/" title="FocusWriter">FocusWriter</a> is probably the best minimalistic writing app I&rsquo;ve come across. It&rsquo;s open source, cross platform and portable too. It has a lot of features but those never get in the way since it can hide a lot of them, which is something that&rsquo;s great for my writing productivity.</p>

<h2 id="markdownpad">MarkdownPad</h2>

<p>Even though I mainly do all of my writing in FocusWriter I find it a good thing to sometimes preview my formatting in another app and that&rsquo;s were <a href="http://markdownpad.com/" title="MarkdownPad">MarkdownPad</a> fits right in with it&rsquo;s excellent live preview.</p>

<h2 id="resophnotes">ResophNotes</h2>

<p><a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html" title="ResophNotes">ResophNotes</a> is the only real dedicated note taking app for Windows with the option of saving the notes in plain text that I&rsquo;ve found. By enabling a global hot key you can pretty much create a note as soon as it pops into your head.</p>

<h2 id="todotxtnet">todotxt.net</h2>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve moved to almost exclusively using plain text for saving pretty much anything I do I&rsquo;ve also started to use an iOS app called <a href="http://todotxt.com/" title="todo.txt">todo.txt</a>. todo.txt provides a graphical interface for a simple plain text file (called todo.txt) and <a href="http://benrhughes.com/todotxt.net/" title="todotxt.net">todotxt.net</a> is the Windows counterpart to it.</p>

<h2 id="uv-outliner">UV Outliner</h2>

<p><a href="http://uvoutliner.com/" title="UV Outliner">UV Outliner</a> is probably the only good single pane outliner for Windows. It can also be used as a task manager if you enable the  checkbox function, which is pretty nice.</p>

<h2 id="launchy">Launchy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launchy is a free cross-platform utility designed to help you forget about your start menu, the icons on your desktop, and even your file manager. Launchy indexes the programs in your start menu and can launch your documents, project files, folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that the description from <a href="http://launchy.net/" title="Launchy">Launchy&rsquo;s official website</a> is sufficient enough so I&rsquo;ll just leave it at that.</p>

<h2 id="autohotkey">AutoHotKey</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" title="AutoHotKey">AutoHotKey</a> is an fantastic little app that you can add your own scripts to. Whether it&rsquo;s about creating a keyboard shortcut for an app, launching a specific document or having a lot of text expansions it can do the job for you.</p>

<h2 id="virtuawin">VirtuaWin</h2>

<p><a href="http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/" title="VirtuaWin">VirtuaWin</a> is a small for enabling up to four virtual desktops on your screen. It&rsquo;s not as fancy as OS X&rsquo;s Spaces and Expose or another vritual desktop app called <a href="http://dexpot.de/" title="Dexpot">Dexpot</a>, but it&rsquo;s extremely lightweight.</p>

<h2 id="shotty">Shotty</h2>

<p>I was looking for something better than the built in snipping tool and I found <a href="http://shotty.devs-on.net/en/Overview.aspx" title="Shotty">Shotty</a>. One of the things I like about it is that it leaves the shadows of your screenshots intact which makes them look a lot nicer. It may not be essential to everybody but since I need to take screenshots from time to time I feel that it has it&rsquo;s spot in this list.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite sites on the web is the <a href="http://usesthis.com/" title="The Setup">The Setup</a>. The tagline for it is <em>&ldquo;What do people use to get stuff done?&rdquo;</em>, which describes the purpose of it really well. It may be the nerd in me but I find it completely fascinating to see what kind of gear and software people in all kind of job fields use<sup id="fnref:20121202-1"><a href="#fn:20121202-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you haven&rsquo;t checked it out and you&rsquo;re as geeky as I am I suggest that you should. There&rsquo;s also a couple of <a href="http://usesthis.com/community/" title="The Setup's Community">spin-offs</a> of the whole idea, which ranges from Linux users to teachers to people with disabilities. I&rsquo;ve been toying with the idea of doing something like that but haven&rsquo;t had the time nor the resources to do so just yet. All in all it&rsquo;s a little fantastic website that I thoroughly enjoy.</p>

        Small Steps Into Ruby

      Posted on November 28, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Code" alt="Code" title="Code">Code</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Ruby" alt="Ruby" title="Ruby">Ruby</a>

    <span class="justified">
      <p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to learn a real programming language. The few times in the past that I&rsquo;ve tried have all been fruitless though. My brain just doesn&rsquo;t work when there&rsquo;s too many complex structures going on at once. Even though I can understand the logic behind certain parts it just won&rsquo;t stick, which is a shame. One of the reasons I think I like writing HTML and and especially CSS is that the syntax is very visual and easy to read. You write <code>background-color: red;</code> and what do you know, the background suddenly is red. With those two you don&rsquo;t have write a short novel just to get the command line to print a simple <em>&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Since this site is built with Jekyll I decided to really start learning <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> and I&rsquo;m glad I did. The syntax is so simple that it amazes me. Over the last few days I&rsquo;ve experimented with it a lot and even released a few simple scripts on <a href="https://github.com/gummesson" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>. One of those was inspired by a post I saw yesterday on 
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5963597/why-you-should-be-using-an-app-launcher-and-how-to-make-it-do-anythingyou-want" title="Lifehacker">Lifehacker</a>. The article mentions how you can use <a href="http://launchy.net/" title="Launchy">Launchy</a> to append text to a text file, but I couldn&rsquo;t get the <code>bat</code> script they recommended to properly work so I decided to just make a <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/append-text" title="Append Text (for Launchy on GitHub">Ruby version of it</a>. The script looks like this without comments:</p>

<pre><code>require 'yaml'

config = YAML.load_file("config.yml")
txt_file = config["txt_file"]

item = ARGV.join(" ")

File.open(txt_file, "a") { |file| file.puts(item) }
</code></pre>

<p>Right now it consists of just five lines of code. I could&rsquo;ve even made it even simpler by leaving out the use of YAML<sup id="fnref:20121128-1"><a href="#fn:20121128-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for the text file configuration<sup id="fnref:20121128-2"><a href="#fn:20121128-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I really like having something like that though since you don&rsquo;t have to change the actual source code if you later decide to use another text file. Now I just need to launch Launchy, type <code>add</code>, <code>TAB</code> and whatever I want to append to the file and just hit <code>Enter</code> to add something to my spark file, which is even faster than launching the actually text file with <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" title="AutoHotKey">AutoHotKey</a> like I mentioned in the previous blog post.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>I found the book <a href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/book/" title="Mr. Neighborly's Humble Little Ruby Book">Mr. Neighborly&rsquo;s Humble Little Ruby Book</a> extremely good. It explains a lot of stuff without getting too technically complex and with a perfect mix of humor. Another book I also found helpful and easy to understand was <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/" title="The Bastards Book of Ruby">The Bastards Book of Ruby</a>. I&rsquo;ve also seen <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/" title="Learn Ruby The Hard Way">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a> and <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" title="Learn To Program">Learn To Program</a> being mentioned quite a few times but so far I haven&rsquo;t had time to check them out. Another tip is that you shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the power of Google and a thriving community. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> is filled with a lot of answers for literally every single question you might have.</p>

<p>I still have a long way to go, but so far it&rsquo;s been a really fun ride.</p>

      <p>A few weeks ago I came across a post on <a href="https://medium.com/" title="Medium">Medium</a> called <a href="https://medium.com/the-writers-room/8d6e7df7ae58" title="The Spark File">The Spark File</a> written by <a href="https://medium.com/@stevenbjohnson" title="Steven Johnson">Steven Johnson</a>. I really liked the idea of having a spark file of some sort but never took the time to try it out. I usually depend on <a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html" title="ResophNotes">ResophNotes</a> when it comes to jotting down ideas but more often than not I&rsquo;ve ended up with text files with just a headline in them, like &ldquo;write about x and y&rdquo;. While it definitively helps me remembering what I want to write about I feel that it&rsquo;s unnecessary to have a ton of one line ideas clutter up my notes. That&rsquo;s where the spark file fits perfectly. I finally understood that it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;ll be a good addition to my writing workflow. Now I&rsquo;ve begun to only use ResophNotes for my blog posts or other types of writing when an idea has involved to something more solid, while the spark file is just a scratchpad for things I want to write about but haven&rsquo;t really figured out yet.</p>

<h2 id="instant-sparks">Instant Sparks</h2>

<p>I threw together a simple <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" title="AutoHotKey">AutoHotKey</a> script so the spark file is just one hotkey away:</p>

<pre><code>!q::
{
Run, Notepad.exe "~/spark-file.txt"
Return
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means that whenever an idea pops up I just need to press <code>Alt+Q</code> and type down whatever&rsquo;s in my head. It&rsquo;s a simple but powerful solution that&rsquo;ll serve me well I think.</p>
