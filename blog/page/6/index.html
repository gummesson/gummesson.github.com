  <p>Yesterday I finally pushed something to the master branch of a thing I started working on last week, <a href="#" title="Smallwork">Smallwork</a>. It’s a small yet full featured <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="SCSS">SCSS</a> framework, or starting point as I’d like to call it. The first time I tried SCSS was way back in August or September but I didn’t really “get” it until I started learning Ruby. The code length measures in at a total of 1156 numbers of lines<sup id="fnref:20130112-1"><a href="#fn:20130112-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which kind of makes it my most ambitious work to date.</p>

<p>I also played around with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> again and came up with a simple journal app which uses <a href="http://datamapper.org/" title="Datamapper">Datamapper</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" title="SQLite 3">SQLite3</a> for storing everything in a database. Like I mentioned earlier I’m quite fond of Sinatra, especially since it’s really easy to understand what do to and what’s going on. The code is so self-explanatory that I sometimes have to pinch myself to see that I’m not in fact dreaming. I’m no expert but I like where I’m going with it and I’ve barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about extending <a href="http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/" title="Kramit!">Kramit!</a> a bit, but we’ll see how that goes… I guess I should try to slow myself down a bit since I’ve launched three new projects this week alone. I’m having fun though!</p>

<div class="footnotes">

      <p>That’s including blank lines and comments. It’s still a pretty big number though. The compiled CSS code is 682 lines long and that’s without any additional content besides the basic structure itself.<a href="#fnref:20130112-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>The day before yesterday I launched my first “web app”, <a href="http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/" title="Kramit!">Kramit!</a>. Like about half a million people on the internet with some kind of web development interest I created yet another <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> preview app and with the wonderful micro web framework <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a>. It’s nothing unique but I’m quite proud nonetheless. I haven’t actually seen that many that uses <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/" title="Kramdown">Kramdown</a> as it’s default parser, so I guess that that aspect is somewhat pretty unique<sup id="fnref:20130110-1"><a href="#fn:20130110-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="more-minimum-than-an-mvp">More minimum than an MVP</h2>

<p><em>Kramit!</em> is at it’s core the definition of an MVP<sup id="fnref:20130110-2"><a href="#fn:20130110-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. The whole thing consists of just 33 lines of Sinatra code, 61 lines of HTML for the views (ie. the layout) and 243 lines of CSS for both the app itself and the preview. A total of 337 lines. That’s nothing! I’m quite amazed that Sinatra makes me able to do so much with barely any code at all. It literally took me just a few hours to go from idea to launch and the hard part wasn’t actually writing the code but rather designing it.<sup id="fnref:20130110-3"><a href="#fn:20130110-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So, what’s next?</h2>

<p>First of all I think I’m continue to play around with Sinatra and the Ruby language itself a bit more and then maybe look at <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>. It’s much more advanced and kind of plays on a whole other field than Sinatra, but it would be fun to learn.</p>

      <p>I like it because it has <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/" title="MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a> features like footnotes for examples (this footnote became very meta by the way).<a href="#fnref:20130110-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:20130110-3">
      <p>I would called myself challenged in that department. My basic design process is “make something up, strip away all the things that I though was going to look good but didn’t, look it at it again and then remove some more”.<a href="#fnref:20130110-3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

  <p>I found this little gem of an app earlier today and I got to say that it was just what I was looking for and needed. I’ve been meaning to minify my code for some time but I haven’t found something simple that could do that. There are some web based apps and services out there that can do it, but I like having a native solution so that it can update itself whenever there’s a new change and so on.</p>

  <p>It’s been nearly a week since I started with venturing into <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a> and so far it’s really been an adventure for sure. I’ve managed to pick up a few new tricks everyday and yesterday I had to stop myself from saving a quick note I was jotting down in another editor with <code>:w</code><sup id="fnref:20130103-1"><a href="#fn:20130103-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which I guess is a good thing. I’ve also managed to scrap together a decent <code>.vimrc</code> file with lots of settings and installed quite a few plugins as well. I feel that using Vim makes me atleast <em>feel</em> a bit more efficient and while the learning curve is steep I do think that I’ll continue to use it. I’ve always been lazy when it comes to learning keyboard shortcuts and even though I think that you should use whatever feels most comfortable to you it’s defintively not a bad thing to be able to move around and edit things fast without having to use the mouse. </p>

<p>I’ve also started a new project<sup id="fnref:20130103-2"><a href="#fn:20130103-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and decided that I’ll only work on it in Vim just to get a good feel for it and to learn how to actually use all the basic ways to get by atleast. That’ll probably prove to be a challenge, but fun nonetheless. I have a lot to learn but I’m equally eager to do that.</p>

  <p>There’s no doubt that if you’ve ever spent some time looking through and reading various developer related things that you’ve seen people mentioning the text editor <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a>. I decided to try it out the graphical version of it, gVim, and it really is a different experience. Instead of relying on trusty old keyboard shortcuts like <code>Ctrl+S</code> you instead have to first hit <code>Esc</code> and type <code>:w</code>. While I’m not a hundred percent sold on it<sup id="fnref:20121230-1"><a href="#fn:20121230-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I can defintively see the appeal, especially for people who love their keyboards. The Vim version of the color scheme <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized" title="Solarized">Solarized</a>, which I absolutely love, looks gorgeous and what I can tell Vim probably has the best Markdown syntax highlighting I’ve ever seen. One other aspect I really like is that you can save all of your settings in a single file which you can then use across multiple systems, since Vim is cross-platform.</p>

<p>I’m still very new to using it, so if I decided to really dive in to it I’m sure I’ll write more about it during the coming weeks.</p>

<h2 id="my-gvim-config">My (g)Vim config</h2>

<p>I naturally wanted to add some settings to make the experience slightly better<sup id="fnref:20121230-2"><a href="#fn:20121230-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and thanks to a lot of different people<sup id="fnref:20121230-3"><a href="#fn:20121230-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> across the web I was able to change quite a whole lot to my liking. I also installed a plugin called <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree" title="NERDTree">NERDTree</a> which adds a sidebar where you can see the files in your project directory. <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen" title="Pathogen">Pathogen</a> is also very helpful when it comes to managing all your plugins. It’s of course available on <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/vimfiles/blob/master/.vimrc" title="My .vimrc on GitHub">my GitHub page</a> and it’s loaded with comments.</p>
