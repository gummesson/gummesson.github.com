      <p>While looking for an easier way to backup and sync a couple of folders on my system I came across an awesomely named command line function called <code>robocopy</code><sup id="fnref:20121211-1"><a href="#fn:20121211-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. One of the things I use it for is to quickly backup the source of my <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a> site to a folder on my <a href="http://dropbox.com/" title="Dropbox">Dropbox</a> with a simple command like this:</p>

<pre><code>robocopy ~/Jekyll ~/Dropbox/Jekyll *.* /mir
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it follows the structure of <code>robocopy -source -destination -file -option</code>. The <code>*.*</code> targets every single filetype and the <code>/mir</code> means that everything, including the subfolders, will get mirrored. There’s a lot of options for it<sup id="fnref:20121211-2"><a href="#fn:20121211-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, ranging from copying a single file once to actually scheduling it for repeated copying. It’s not really a syncing function per se, but it works and it’s blazingly fast. I’m not really bothered by the fact that I have to manually run it either since I don’t need to sync everytime something changes.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage of using Robocopy is that it’s just a lot more smoother, especially since I’ve gotten more and more comfortable using the command line for everyday tasks. I can open up the CLI from anywhere, trigger a hotstring for pasting the above snippet and just hit <code>Enter</code>.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>A couple of months back I wrote a blog post called <em><a href="/blog/2012/09/20/the-joys-of-writing/" title="The Joys Of Writing">“The Joys of Writing”</a></em> where I expressed my love for the craft that is writing. While I still feel the same I’ve also found it quite hard from time to time, especially during the last couple of weeks. In other words, the honeymoon period of starting this website is over. I sit down, launch <a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html" title="ResophNotes">ResophNotes</a>, look through my notes and find a topic I want to write about but absolutely nothing comes out. Not even a word. It’s a good old-fashioned writer’s block and I hate it. Even though I probably have a very low number of readers<sup id="fnref:20121209-1"><a href="#fn:20121209-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I still like to write and I feel quite powerless when I can’t do so. In short, writing keeps me sane. </p>

<p>I realize as I type this out that this blog post has a goodbye vibe written all over it, but fortunately that’s not the case. I just need to vent out some of my frustration. I’m going to keep fighting it and I hope that I’ll come out of it sooner than later. I guess that in a sense this post is already a step in the right direction.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Here’s a list of what I consider awesome apps and utilities for Windows. Even though there’s no shortage of them I sometimes find that it’s quite hard to find those gems that really stand out.</p>

<h2 id="focuswriter">FocusWriter</h2>

<p><a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/" title="FocusWriter">FocusWriter</a> is probably the best minimalistic writing app I’ve come across. It’s open source, cross platform and portable too. It has a lot of features but those never get in the way since it can hide a lot of them, which is something that’s great for my writing productivity.</p>

<h2 id="markdownpad">MarkdownPad</h2>

<p>Even though I mainly do all of my writing in FocusWriter I find it a good thing to sometimes preview my formatting in another app and that’s were <a href="http://markdownpad.com/" title="MarkdownPad">MarkdownPad</a> fits right in with it’s excellent live preview.</p>

<h2 id="resophnotes">ResophNotes</h2>

<p><a href="http://resoph.com/ResophNotes/Welcome.html" title="ResophNotes">ResophNotes</a> is the only real dedicated note taking app for Windows with the option of saving the notes in plain text that I’ve found. By enabling a global hot key you can pretty much create a note as soon as it pops into your head.</p>

<h2 id="todotxtnet">todotxt.net</h2>

<p>Since I’ve moved to almost exclusively using plain text for saving pretty much anything I do I’ve also started to use an iOS app called <a href="http://todotxt.com/" title="todo.txt">todo.txt</a>. todo.txt provides a graphical interface for a simple plain text file (called todo.txt) and <a href="http://benrhughes.com/todotxt.net/" title="todotxt.net">todotxt.net</a> is the Windows counterpart to it.</p>

<h2 id="uv-outliner">UV Outliner</h2>

<p><a href="http://uvoutliner.com/" title="UV Outliner">UV Outliner</a> is probably the only good single pane outliner for Windows. It can also be used as a task manager if you enable the  checkbox function, which is pretty nice.</p>

<h2 id="launchy">Launchy</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Launchy is a free cross-platform utility designed to help you forget about your start menu, the icons on your desktop, and even your file manager. Launchy indexes the programs in your start menu and can launch your documents, project files, folders, and bookmarks with just a few keystrokes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that the description from <a href="http://launchy.net/" title="Launchy">Launchy’s official website</a> is sufficient enough so I’ll just leave it at that.</p>

<h2 id="autohotkey">AutoHotKey</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" title="AutoHotKey">AutoHotKey</a> is an fantastic little app that you can add your own scripts to. Whether it’s about creating a keyboard shortcut for an app, launching a specific document or having a lot of text expansions it can do the job for you.</p>

<h2 id="virtuawin">VirtuaWin</h2>

<p><a href="http://virtuawin.sourceforge.net/" title="VirtuaWin">VirtuaWin</a> is a small for enabling up to four virtual desktops on your screen. It’s not as fancy as OS X’s Spaces and Expose or another vritual desktop app called <a href="http://dexpot.de/" title="Dexpot">Dexpot</a>, but it’s extremely lightweight.</p>

<h2 id="shotty">Shotty</h2>

<p>I was looking for something better than the built in snipping tool and I found <a href="http://shotty.devs-on.net/en/Overview.aspx" title="Shotty">Shotty</a>. One of the things I like about it is that it leaves the shadows of your screenshots intact which makes them look a lot nicer. It may not be essential to everybody but since I need to take screenshots from time to time I feel that it has it’s spot in this list.</p>

      <p>One of my favorite sites on the web is the <a href="http://usesthis.com/" title="The Setup">The Setup</a>. The tagline for it is <em>“What do people use to get stuff done?”</em>, which describes the purpose of it really well. It may be the nerd in me but I find it completely fascinating to see what kind of gear and software people in all kind of job fields use<sup id="fnref:20121202-1"><a href="#fn:20121202-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If you haven’t checked it out and you’re as geeky as I am I suggest that you should. There’s also a couple of <a href="http://usesthis.com/community/" title="The Setup's Community">spin-offs</a> of the whole idea, which ranges from Linux users to teachers to people with disabilities. I’ve been toying with the idea of doing something like that but haven’t had the time nor the resources to do so just yet. All in all it’s a little fantastic website that I thoroughly enjoy.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>I’ve always wanted to learn a real programming language. The few times in the past that I’ve tried have all been fruitless though. My brain just doesn’t work when there’s too many complex structures going on at once. Even though I can understand the logic behind certain parts it just won’t stick, which is a shame. One of the reasons I think I like writing HTML and and especially CSS is that the syntax is very visual and easy to read. You write <code>background-color: red;</code> and what do you know, the background suddenly is red. With those two you don’t have write a short novel just to get the command line to print a simple <em>“Hello World”</em>.</p>

<p>Since this site is built with Jekyll I decided to really start learning <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> and I’m glad I did. The syntax is so simple that it amazes me. Over the last few days I’ve experimented with it a lot and even released a few simple scripts on <a href="https://github.com/gummesson" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>. One of those was inspired by a post I saw yesterday on 
<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5963597/why-you-should-be-using-an-app-launcher-and-how-to-make-it-do-anythingyou-want" title="Lifehacker">Lifehacker</a>. The article mentions how you can use <a href="http://launchy.net/" title="Launchy">Launchy</a> to append text to a text file, but I couldn’t get the <code>bat</code> script they recommended to properly work so I decided to just make a <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/append-text" title="Append Text (for Launchy on GitHub">Ruby version of it</a>. The script looks like this without comments:</p>

<pre><code>require 'yaml'

config = YAML.load_file("config.yml")
txt_file = config["txt_file"]

item = ARGV.join(" ")

File.open(txt_file, "a") { |file| file.puts(item) }
</code></pre>

<p>Right now it consists of just five lines of code. I could’ve even made it even simpler by leaving out the use of YAML<sup id="fnref:20121128-1"><a href="#fn:20121128-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> for the text file configuration<sup id="fnref:20121128-2"><a href="#fn:20121128-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. I really like having something like that though since you don’t have to change the actual source code if you later decide to use another text file. Now I just need to launch Launchy, type <code>add</code>, <code>TAB</code> and whatever I want to append to the file and just hit <code>Enter</code> to add something to my spark file, which is even faster than launching the actually text file with <a href="http://www.autohotkey.com/" title="AutoHotKey">AutoHotKey</a> like I mentioned in the previous blog post.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>I found the book <a href="http://www.humblelittlerubybook.com/book/" title="Mr. Neighborly's Humble Little Ruby Book">Mr. Neighborly’s Humble Little Ruby Book</a> extremely good. It explains a lot of stuff without getting too technically complex and with a perfect mix of humor. Another book I also found helpful and easy to understand was <a href="http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/" title="The Bastards Book of Ruby">The Bastards Book of Ruby</a>. I’ve also seen <a href="http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/book/" title="Learn Ruby The Hard Way">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a> and <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/" title="Learn To Program">Learn To Program</a> being mentioned quite a few times but so far I haven’t had time to check them out. Another tip is that you shouldn’t underestimate the power of Google and a thriving community. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby" title="Stack Overflow">Stack Overflow</a> is filled with a lot of answers for literally every single question you might have.</p>

<p>I still have a long way to go, but so far it’s been a really fun ride.</p>
