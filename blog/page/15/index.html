        <p>I’ve been meaning to change the <a href="/archives">archives</a> for a long time since having all the posts in a single list doesn’t look that great and can become quite messy after awhile. Thanks to the magic wonders of Google I found a a really neat solution: a small plugin<sup id="fnref:20121111-1"><a href="#fn:20121111-1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> that sorts your posts by month and year. It goes through all your posts and just generates a simple single <code>archives.html</code> page which is exactly want I wanted. It amazes me that people actually takes time and just write code that’ll help someone like me tremendously. I’m extremely thankful for that.</p>

        <p>Around a week ago <a href="/blog/2012/10/29/hotstrings-and-markdown/">I wrote about AutoHotKey</a> and how it could be used when it came to more general things like using abbreviations for your name or website in order to speed up your writing. I also wrote a bit about how to use it to make your markdown writing even faster. I finally sat down and played around with different ways to create more efficient scripts and came up with a couple of new things. I also figured out how to move the cursor’s position so you can start typing right away instead of having to manually move it<sup id="fnref:20121110-1"><a href="#fn:20121110-1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. I put them up for download on <a href="https://github.com/gummesson">my GitHub page</a> so if you’re looking for something like that go ahead and use it and feel free to adjust it to your liking.</p>

      <p>The cursor gets placed somewhere inside the actual Markdown snippet. It’s pretty handy.<a href="#fnref:20121110-1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>

          </p>
        
        <p>Earlier today I look into some simple solution to enable support for footnotes since that’s something that regular Markdown doesn’t cover<sup id="fnref:20121109-1"><a href="#fn:20121109-1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. My current Markdown interpreter, <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount">rdiscount</a>, sadly doesn’t have any support for it but another one called <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/">kramdown</a> do. I thought that maybe kramdown was going to be significantly slower<sup id="fnref:20121109-2"><a href="#fn:20121109-2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> but it’s actually hardly noticeable. According to the <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html">syntax</a> it processes the markdown a little differently but luckily I haven’t noticed any changes, since I was worried for a while that I’d had to edit some posts. I did however had to add some thing in my CSS so that the footnotes didn’t look to out of place, but since the markup consists of some attribute selectors that didn’t turn out to be a big hassle either.</p>

<p>So to wrap this short post up, if you’re looking for a pretty fast markdown interpreter for Jekyll that has some additional features you should definitively try out kramdown.</p>

          </p>
        
        <p>After trying Squarespace Note for a few days I decided that it wasn’t really for me. Even though I feel in love with the interface I couldn’t really get over the fact that I couldn’t choose another folder other than the app’s default to save my notes to in Dropbox. I still think it’s a very competent and useful app though, but it’s just not my cup of tea. I decided to look for something else and I did find a worthy replacement: <a href="http://minimaltools.com/" title="Minimal Tools - Pop">Pop</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pop">Pop</h2>

<p>The description from <a href="http://minimaltools.com/" title="Minimal Tools – Pop">the official website</a> describes the purpose of the app perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pop is simply a convenient place for writing things down — that piece of paper you grab to write when you have an idea. It doesn’t help you do anything smarter or more organized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that’s there’s no integration with any other service or app whatsoever. You’re only able to write down what you want to keep, and then select it all and copy it to another text editor for further editing and writing. I love that. Note was really similiar to my default text editor, <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" title="iA Writer">iA Writer</a>, while Pop certainly isn’t. I can only use one blank “canvas” to write down my ideas and thoughts. There’s nothing to fiddle with. That feels quite refreshing to be honest (I actually wrote the majority of this post in said app). My handwriting is incredibly messy so it’s nice to have an app that can quite frankly replace my need for an actual physical notebook. </p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-11-06-pop-for-ios.png" alt="Pop for iOS (with a swedish keyboard)" title="Pop for iOS (with a swedish keyboard)" /></p>

<p>I feel confident that Pop is going to prove itself useful for me. I’m absolutely certain that I’m going to continue to use it as a springboard for ideas, blog posts and just general thoughts. Just like how it’s meant to be used, in my opinion.</p>

          </p>
        
        <p>If you’re reading this you should’ve noticed that the design once again has changed. I tried to made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t fiddle with the site’s design for a week but obviously that didn’t work out. I did find a rather stunning typeface, <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Tinos">Tinos</a>, and I decided to run with it while the inspiration was high. I think that it looks so much cleaner now and I’ve finally limited my need to change things around on the site. I’m confident that this reincarnation of it will stick around much longer than the previous ones (that shouldn’t be too hard since I’ve had two different designs since the end of August this year).</p>

<p><em>I really need to find a good monthly archives plugin for Jekyll though since the post count is getting too high to work with the current solution which just lists them all, but that’s a different story.</em></p>
