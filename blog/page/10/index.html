      <p>Yesterday while I was traveling a bit by train I read Paul Miller&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/label/offline" title="Paul Miller's offline series on The Verge">offline series</a> on The Verge about his year without internet. Admittedly I&rsquo;ve previously only skimmed through a couple of the articles, but I decided to catch up on all of them since I had some time to kill during my ride. I think it&rsquo;s an intriguing idea yet at the same time a bit nightmarish. I mean, without an internet connection I wouldn&rsquo;t even have read the articles. I think that a lot of people around my age can all relate to living their lives in some form or another through the internet and I&rsquo;d probably be bored to death if I couldn&rsquo;t use it at all. It might be sad, but it&rsquo;s true nonetheless. The feeling of not being able to have an immediate access to instant information about pretty much anything would be more than overwhelming. I don&rsquo;t know if I should feel bad about it either&hellip; Perhaps not, I guess?</p>

      <p>The iPhone/iPad version of <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/se/app/ia-writer/id392502056?mt=8" title="iA Writer">iA Writer</a> (which I use) got an update just in time for the release of iOS 6, and I&rsquo;m really happy about the fact that it now finally has a Markdown preview mode. I was actually looking around for another app that had a function like that, but now I think I&rsquo;m going to stick around with using it (even though <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8" title="Drafts">Drafts</a> looks good too).</p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-09-30-ia-writer-preview.png" alt="iA Writer - Preview Mode" title="iA Writer - Preview Mode" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not that keen on how the text in the preview is formatted, but it&rsquo;s no the end of the world because I don&rsquo;t really use the app to write huge text pieces on my phone or anything like that. I think I&rsquo;m good as long as I&rsquo;m just using for capturing quick notes with ideas for blog posts and other writing related stuff.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>In the same vein as my recent RSS cleaning (mentioned in <a href="http://ellengummesson.com/blog/2012/09/17/cleaning-up/" title="Cleaning Up">this blog post</a>) I&rsquo;ve also started to declutter my computers from unneccassary apps, and I recently finally managed to achieve a inbox zero on my primary mail account (I&rsquo;ve always been bad at it and I usually keep emails for way too long, but over the course of a couple of sessions I managed to get it under control by archiving a lot of emails and throwing away even more). But anways, back to the main topic of the post: decluttering your computer from stuff you don&rsquo;t need. When I got my new computer at the start of August I realized that I actually didn&rsquo;t need to install that many apps and that I mostly only had to install one per need. There are of course a few exceptions to that rule, like text editors for example, but those are often not that heavy on the system anyways.</p>

<p>Just before I started university I got a small <em>Samsung NC10</em> netbook as a gift. Even though it was far from a beast, it was a life saver during lectures and group projects. I&rsquo;ve tried to keep it pretty clean and not having too many things on it, but I had to have a couple of heavier apps installed due to actually working on school projects on it. I also use it as my main machine when I was home during holidays. Now that I don&rsquo;t have to use it for those to primary things I decided to really clean it up and use it only for browsing and the occasional writing session. I think I had about 85% of hard drive space left when I was done, and that&rsquo;s including the OS. The boot time is actually quite minimal seeing as the computer is over three years old. I&rsquo;m actually toying with the idea to use it more now, especially since I&rsquo;m getting more more and more into writing long form posts, which I can thank the decluttering for. In that retrospect you could say that less really is more.</p>

<p><em>Another side note is that every app I have installed on this computer is free, which is quite awesome really. I think that I&rsquo;ll write more on that particular subject later.</em></p>

      <p>I really doubt that anybody hasn&rsquo;t seen the above website, but it still makes me laugh like a madman. The second largest city in Sweden (Gothenburg) no longer exists and I apparently live in my neighbor&rsquo;s bushes, not in my actual house as I would expect.</p>
