    <p>In the same vein as my recent RSS cleaning (mentioned in <a href="http://ellengummesson.com/blog/2012/09/17/cleaning-up/" title="Cleaning Up">this blog post</a>) I've also started to declutter my computers from unneccassary apps, and I recently finally managed to achieve a inbox zero on my primary mail account (I've always been bad at it and I usually keep emails for way too long, but over the course of a couple of sessions I managed to get it under control by archiving a lot of emails and throwing away even more). But anways, back to the main topic of the post: decluttering your computer from stuff you don't need. When I got my new computer at the start of August I realized that I actually didn't need to install that many apps and that I mostly only had to install one per need. There are of course a few exceptions to that rule, like text editors for example, but those are often not that heavy on the system anyways.</p>

<p>Just before I started university I got a small <em>Samsung NC10</em> netbook as a gift. Even though it was far from a beast, it was a life saver during lectures and group projects. I've tried to keep it pretty clean and not having too many things on it, but I had to have a couple of heavier apps installed due to actually working on school projects on it. I also use it as my main machine when I was home during holidays. Now that I don't have to use it for those to primary things I decided to really clean it up and use it only for browsing and the occasional writing session. I think I had about 85% of hard drive space left when I was done, and that's including the OS. The boot time is actually quite minimal seeing as the computer is over three years old. I'm actually toying with the idea to use it more now, especially since I'm getting more more and more into writing long form posts, which I can thank the decluttering for. In that retrospect you could say that less really is more.</p>

<p><em>Another side note is that every app I have installed on this computer is free, which is quite awesome really. I think that I'll write more on that particular subject later.</em></p>

    <p>I really doubt that anybody hasn't seen the above website, but it still makes me laugh like a madman. The second largest city in Sweden (Gothenburg) no longer exists and I apparently live in my neighbor's bushes, not in my actual house as I would expect.</p>

    <p class="post-meta small-margin">Posted on September 23, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Tech" alt="Tech" title="Tech" class="no-border">Tech</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Apps" alt="Apps" title="Apps" class="no-border">Apps</a>  </p>
  
    <p>A new version of <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/" title="FocusWriter 1.4.0">FocusWriter 1.4.0</a> was just released yesterday. Quite a lot has changed since in the app since I was previously using 1.3.6 since it was the latest stable release. This version feels like a big step up. The biggest changes in my opinion is that you now have the option to change the line spacing in your themes and that the save dialog won't force you to either save your document as a .txt or a .rtf file, which is good news if you're writing in <em>Markdown</em> like I do.</p>

<p>My favorite new feature is the focus mode. The focus mode lets you chose to focus on either one line, three lines or a paragraph by "blurring" out the rest of the text by changing it's opacity (or something to that effect), which makes it blend in with the background and thus lets you focus on the the current focused text. This feature can also be found in <em>iA Writer</em>, which seems to be a constant inspiration for the development of <em>FocusWriter</em> by the way (I don't see that as a bad thing though), although the former only lets you focus on one sentence at a time.</p>

<p><img src='/images/blog/2012-09-23-focuswriter-140.png' title='Focus mode in FocusWriter 1.4.0' alt='Focus mode in FocusWriter 1.4.0'></p>

<p>There's also a new function called <em>Scenes</em>, but I doubt I'll use it that much since I personally don't need it form my kind of writing. It essentially lets you create markers for different scenes in your document separating them by using a couple of characters. The default detection for a new scene is two hashes (which coincidentally is a second level heading in <em>Markdown</em>). I could see it being handy if I'm writing a really long blog post containing lots of headings though. <em>FocusWriter</em> is first and foremost made for writers, so there's definitively a use for that type of thing. All in all I still think that <em>FocusWriter</em> is the best writing app I've come across.</p>

    <p>The battery life on my <em>iPhone 4S</em> has improved when I'm not using 3G or WiFi...but it's gotten worse when I'm actually using something that requires an internet connection to work. Granted I only upgraded to <em>iOS 6</em> about two days ago, so maybe it'll get better with time.</p>

<p>One step forward and one step back, I guess?</p>

    <p>After about a month of what I would say is fairly regularly blogging on this website I've come to the conclusion that I really love to write, even though I'm not sure that anybody is actually reading it. A couple of years ago I toyed with the idea to actually study to become a journalist, but that didn't plan out. In hindsight, it was probably for the best. I did get a small freelance job as a music writer and reviewer that lasted about a year, which I enjoyed even though I think I got a bit repetitive at the end of the run. My newfound love of writing is probably what keeps me going. I haven't set up an <em>Google Analytics</em> account nor a <em>FeedBurner</em> either, just because I realize that statistics doesn't really matter much to me. Sure, I would be really happy to know that someone appreciate my writing and what I have to say, but I'm mostly doing it for the sake of myself. It doesn't hurt that I'm probably getting better and better at it either.</p>
