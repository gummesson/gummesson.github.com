      <p>I don’t know what’s been up with me lately but I do know that during the last couple of weeks I’ve “shipped” a lot of things. I mean, most of them are basic things but I’ve had fun while doing them. So yesterday I added yet another repo to <a href="https://github.com/gummesson" title="My GitHub account">my GitHub account</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/serve" title="Serve">Serve</a>. <em>Serve</em> is a static site generator which focuses on generating small sites that only need to consist of a few pages at the most.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>It started with an faint idea. I wanted to build something useful that could parse a couple of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> files and convert them to static HTML files. It’s no secret that I absolutely adore <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, but I tend to roll with an idea once I get it. I first threw together a one file script that had the same basic functionality and went from there. My goal was to really learn how to use modules and classes since I’ve mostly shied away from them<sup id="fnref:20130120-1"><a href="#fn:20130120-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I looked at a lot of different projects on <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> but to be honest I couldn’t really comprehend everything, since I’m still pretty inexperienced when it comes to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> and programming languages in general. I didn’t just want to give up though. I was going to finish my newly started projects goddamnit, even if it would take me months. </p>

<p>It suddenly clicked for me and I <em>finally</em> got “it”<sup id="fnref:20130120-2"><a href="#fn:20130120-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is such an amazing feeling. It didn’t take too long for me to transform the ugly script into it’s current state. I’m not saying it’s perfect but it looks a hell of a lot nicer then it did when I started and it sort of keeps me excited to continue to learn.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Learning stuff is awesome, especially when you notice your own progress.</p>

      <p>I’ve of course read about them and have an basic understanding of their purpose but actually seeing them in action and implementing them is so much better for my learning experience.<a href="#fnref:20130120-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
    </li>
    <li id="fn:20130120-2">
      <p>With “it” I mean how to use them to get them to work with the rest of the code. “Inheritance!” was literally the thing that popped up in my head that made me understand everything. It’s funny how the brain works sometimes.<a href="#fnref:20130120-2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>My experiments with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> framework continues and yesterday I pushed yet another app to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" title="Heroku">Heroku</a> called <a href="http://slugize.ellengummesson.com/" title="Slugize">Slugize</a>. It only has one small purpose: creating a slug out of a blog title, which can be pretty handy when you use a static site generator like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I usually don’t decide on a title until a few seconds before I “hit publish” which means that fixing the slug is usually the last thing I do. I find it extremely annoying that I have to manually type out <code>-</code> between every word in the title and change every letter to be in downcase<sup id="fnref:20130115-1"><a href="#fn:20130115-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I guess you can call it lazyiness too. Now I only need to copy and paste the title into <em>Slugize</em> and it’ll do it automatically for me and I also added an option to append the current day’s date to it. It’s funny how being lazy sometimes makes you more productive.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I finally pushed something to the master branch of a thing I started working on last week, <a href="#" title="Smallwork">Smallwork</a>. It’s a small yet full featured <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="SCSS">SCSS</a> framework, or starting point as I’d like to call it. The first time I tried SCSS was way back in August or September but I didn’t really “get” it until I started learning Ruby. The code length measures in at a total of 1156 numbers of lines<sup id="fnref:20130112-1"><a href="#fn:20130112-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which kind of makes it my most ambitious work to date.</p>

<p>I also played around with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> again and came up with a simple journal app which uses <a href="http://datamapper.org/" title="Datamapper">Datamapper</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" title="SQLite 3">SQLite3</a> for storing everything in a database. Like I mentioned earlier I’m quite fond of Sinatra, especially since it’s really easy to understand what do to and what’s going on. The code is so self-explanatory that I sometimes have to pinch myself to see that I’m not in fact dreaming. I’m no expert but I like where I’m going with it and I’ve barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I’m also thinking about extending <a href="http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/" title="Kramit!">Kramit!</a> a bit, but we’ll see how that goes… I guess I should try to slow myself down a bit since I’ve launched three new projects this week alone. I’m having fun though!</p>

      <p>That’s including blank lines and comments. It’s still a pretty big number though. The compiled CSS code is 682 lines long and that’s without any additional content besides the basic structure itself.<a href="#fnref:20130112-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>The day before yesterday I launched my first “web app”, <a href="http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/" title="Kramit!">Kramit!</a>. Like about half a million people on the internet with some kind of web development interest I created yet another <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> preview app and with the wonderful micro web framework <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a>. It’s nothing unique but I’m quite proud nonetheless. I haven’t actually seen that many that uses <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/" title="Kramdown">Kramdown</a> as it’s default parser, so I guess that that aspect is somewhat pretty unique<sup id="fnref:20130110-1"><a href="#fn:20130110-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<h2 id="more-minimum-than-an-mvp">More Minimum Than An MVP</h2>

<p><em>Kramit!</em> is at it’s core the definition of an MVP<sup id="fnref:20130110-2"><a href="#fn:20130110-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. The whole thing consists of just 33 lines of Sinatra code, 61 lines of HTML for the views (ie. the layout) and 243 lines of CSS for both the app itself and the preview. A total of 337 lines. That’s nothing! I’m quite amazed that Sinatra makes me able to do so much with barely any code at all. It literally took me just a few hours to go from idea to launch and the hard part wasn’t actually writing the code but rather designing it.<sup id="fnref:20130110-3"><a href="#fn:20130110-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So, What’s Next?</h2>

<p>First of all I think I’m continue to play around with Sinatra and the Ruby language itself a bit more and then maybe look at <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Ruby on Rails</a>. It’s much more advanced and kind of plays on a whole other field than Sinatra, but it would be fun to learn.</p>

<hr />

<div class="footnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:20130110-1">
      <p>I like it because it has <a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/" title="MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a> features like footnotes for examples (this footnote became very meta by the way).<a href="#fnref:20130110-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <li id="fn:20130110-3">
      <p>I would called myself challenged in that department. My basic design process is “make something up, strip away all the things that I though was going to look good but didn’t, look it at it again and then remove some more”.<a href="#fnref:20130110-3" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
