  <p>Beginning this Fall, we will begin phasing out our Echofon desktop products (Mac, Windows, Firefox) in order to focus more on our mobile line of Echofon apps.</p>

<p>This is such a shame. <a href="http://www.echofon.com/">Echofon</a> is probably the best one column Twitter client for Windows users (if not the only one). I guess I need to find something else then.</p>

  <p>I hate having a clouded desktop (it never looks good in my opinion) but I like to be able to open apps and documents really fast. As soon as an idea pops into my head I want to have the opportunity to write it down (or whatever I need to do) and run with it, so to speak. I’ve tried a minimal approach by just using the built-in search function in Windows 7 which is located in the start menu. It works okay for finding apps and such but the indexing of documents is horrendous to say the least. You can’t really add and choose what you want to include either. While looking for a worthy alternative to it I found <a href="http://www.launchy.net/">Launchy</a>. </p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-10-16-launchy.png" alt="Launchy" /></p>

<p>Launchy is an open source, cross platform (which means that it’s right up my alley) utility application similiar to <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2531">Spotlight</a>, <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">LaunchBar</a> for OS X. I’ve now used it for about a week or so and I can already tell that’s it’s going to be added to my essential apps list. It’s fast, you can include and exclude anything you want, search the web, do simple math calculations and also change it’s appearance (I use the <a href="http://artblanc.deviantart.com/art/Loupe-for-Launchy-264482213">Loupe</a> skin). It’ll also learn what you mean when you search for something, which meaning that Launchy will list the thing that you use the most when you type in something that corresponds with the filename. An example for that is that when I search for the folder where I have my website, which is suprisingly called “Jekyll”, I only have to hit a simple “j” on my keyboard for it to pick up that I mean that particular folder. It’s awesome.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong><br />
There’s a lot of skins available on <a href="http://browse.deviantart.com/customization/skins/applaunchers/launchy/">DeviantART</a>, go check them out if you’re looking for some nice alternatives.</p>

  <p>During the last couple of years I’ve tried a lot of todo apps and techniques. I’ve used pen and paper, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/">Google Calendar</a>, a regular calendar, whatever default app my phone came with, using my own memory, <a href="http://www.any.do/">Any.DO</a>, <a href="https://cheddarapp.com/">Cheddar</a>, post-it notes and so on. While they’ve certainly done their job and some of them have been stunningly beautiful I’ve never felt they were quite right for me. At first I couldn’t really pinpoint what I felt was wrong with them all, but after I’ve started to use plain text for nearly everything I do I can now say that it all boils down to two things: portability and easy editing. Since I came to realize this I’ve ditched all the fancy todo apps I previously used and tried out for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?mt=8">todo.txt Touch</a> and <a href="http://benrhughes.com/todotxt.net/">todotxt.net</a> with the simple default <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format">formatting</a> for the official project.</p>

<p>Storing your todo list in a plain text file is, like <a href="/blog/2012/10/07/the-one-about-markdown/">I’ve stated earlier</a>, future proof as long as I have a simple text editor installed, which means that I can edit them on any practically any computer or modern device. That’s something that not every todo app can do which can be frustrating since you’re often restricted to primarily one device. Obviously there’s cross platform todo apps too, but I’ve found that that they still feel too restrictive for me. A thing that’s great about using a plain text todo file is that you never have to rely to heavily on someone else’s database for storage, which ties in with the whole portability mentality. I do have my todo.txt on my Dropbox account but I can still access it even if I’m offline and more importantly, it’s still just a plain text file. I do really like a good and innovative interface but in this case I think that the simplest approach is the best approach, atleast for me.</p>

  <p>A lengthy article from <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/">MakeUseOf</a> that lists ten well-known internet trends and links to a couple of other articles with more details about them. It’s a good read if you want to kill some time and take a look at some internet history. Or something.</p>
