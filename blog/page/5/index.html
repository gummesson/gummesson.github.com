      <p>During the last couple of years I&rsquo;ve tried a lot of todo apps and techniques. I&rsquo;ve used pen and paper, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/" title="Google Calendar">Google Calendar</a>, a regular calendar, whatever default app my phone came with, using my own memory, <a href="http://www.any.do/" title="Any.DO">Any.DO</a>, <a href="https://cheddarapp.com/" title="Cheddar">Cheddar</a>, post-it notes and so on. While they&rsquo;ve certainly done their job and some of them have been stunningly beautiful I&rsquo;ve never felt they were quite right for me. At first I couldn&rsquo;t really pinpoint what I felt was wrong with them all, but after I&rsquo;ve started to use plain text for nearly everything I do I can now say that it all boils down to two things: portability and easy editing. Since I came to realize this I&rsquo;ve ditched all the fancy todo apps I previously used and tried out for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/se/app/todo.txt-touch/id491342186?mt=8" title="todo.txt Touch">todo.txt Touch</a> and <a href="http://benrhughes.com/todotxt.net/" title="todotxt.net">todotxt.net</a> with the simple default <a href="https://github.com/ginatrapani/todo.txt-cli/wiki/The-Todo.txt-Format" title="The Todo.txt Format">formatting</a> for the official project.</p>

<p>Storing your todo list in a plain text file is, like <a href="/blog/2012/10/07/the-one-about-markdown/" title="The One About Markdown">I&rsquo;ve stated earlier</a>, future proof as long as I have a simple text editor installed, which means that I can edit them on any practically any computer or modern device. That&rsquo;s something that not every todo app can do which can be frustrating since you&rsquo;re often restricted to primarily one device. Obviously there&rsquo;s cross platform todo apps too, but I&rsquo;ve found that that they still feel too restrictive for me. A thing that&rsquo;s great about using a plain text todo file is that you never have to rely to heavily on someone else&rsquo;s database for storage, which ties in with the whole portability mentality. I do have my todo.txt on my Dropbox account but I can still access it even if I&rsquo;m offline and more importantly, it&rsquo;s still just a plain text file. I do really like a good and innovative interface but in this case I think that the simplest approach is the best approach, atleast for me.</p>

      <p>When I first heard about <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> a couple of month ago it sparked my interest. I&rsquo;ve never really felt comfortable writing in a word processor nor in a WYSIWYG editor, so using something that would make it possible to write in any text editor while maintaining a kind of form of formatting sounded like a perfect solution that would really benefit my needs. It was originally created <em>&ldquo;to be used as a format for writing for the web&rdquo;</em>, ie. an easier way to convert plain text with a simple formatting to HTML. I won&rsquo;t go in to further detail one why I think it&rsquo;s great, but if you need more convincing or just want to read some more on this particular subject I suggest that you scroll down to the bottom of this blog post and read a couple of links I&rsquo;ve collected about Markdown and plain text. Trust me, it&rsquo;s worth it!</p>

<h2 id="formatting">Formatting</h2>

<p>The formatting of the syntax is really, really simple to remember. I honestly don&rsquo;t even think about anymore it when I write since it&rsquo;s become like second nature to me. If you want to get a closer look of the whole syntax I suggest that you go to the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" title="Markdown Syntax">official documentation</a>.</p>

<h3 id="headings">Headings</h3>

<pre><code># Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6
</code></pre>

<p>A hashtag represents a heading, where each hashtag equals to the size of the heading, ie. a first level heading becomes a <code>h1</code> tag and so on when it&rsquo;s converted to HTML.</p>

<h3 id="annotations">Annotations</h3>

<pre><code>*Bold* 
**Italic**
***Bold and italic***
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You can also use <code>_</code> instead of <code>*</code> too.</p>

<h3 id="links">Links</h3>

<pre><code>[Click Here](http://www.example.com/ "Example.com") 

[Click Here][example]
[example]: http://www.example.com/ "Example.com"

&lt;http://www.example.com/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There&rsquo;s three ways to create a link. The rule of thumb is that the word you want to make clickable goes in to <code>[]</code> while the actual URL and title tag goes in between <code>()</code>. You can also use <code>&lt;&gt;</code> if you just want to make an URL clickable.</p>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> The second example is useful when you don&rsquo;t want to clutter your text with the URL and the title.</p>

<h3 id="unordered-lists">Unordered Lists</h3>

<pre><code>- One 
- Two
- Three
- Four
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You can also use <code>*</code> or <code>+</code> when you&rsquo;re dealing with an unordered list.</p>

<h3 id="ordered-lists">Ordered Lists</h3>

<pre><code>1. One 
2. Two
3. Three
4. Four
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Side note:</strong> You don&rsquo;t actually have to numerically order your list if you&rsquo;re going to export it to HTML, but I don&rsquo;t really see the point of not doing that.</p>

<h3 id="blockquotes">Blockquotes</h3>

<pre><code>&gt; Lorem ipsum...
</code></pre>

<p><em>Side note:</em> Even if your quote is longer than a single line you only really have to use a <code>&gt;</code> at the beginning of the quote.</p>

<h3 id="images">Images</h3>

<pre><code>![Alt Text](http://www.example.com/images/picture.jpg "Title Text")
</code></pre>

<p>Adding an image is really similar to adding a link. This may be the most &ldquo;inconvenient&rdquo; feature of the syntax since you have no real control over the image&rsquo;s width and height, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem if you size it the way you want it beforehand.</p>

<h3 id="code">Code</h3>

<pre><code>`.inline-code` 

    .code-block {
      color: #000;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>You have to indent the code with four spaces or a tab to create a code block.</p>

<h2 id="editors">Editors</h2>

<p>Basically any text editor will do since Markdown is just really plain text, but that may not be the most optimal thing (I&rsquo;m a sucker for a good interface). While there&rsquo;s a plethora of markdown-friendly text editors for iOS and OSX there&rsquo;s not a lot of them for Windows. I personally use <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/" title="FocusWriter">FocusWriter</a> (which doesn&rsquo;t really support Markdown) and <a href="http://www.markdownpad.com/" title="MarkdownPad">MarkdownPad</a> and  I&rsquo;ve played around with <a href="http://writemonkey.com/" title="WriteMonkey">WriteMonkey</a> and <a href="http://code52.org/DownmarkerWPF/" title="Markpad">Markpad</a>. I&rsquo;ve also stumbled across <a href="http://www.mdcharm.com/" title="mdCharm">mdCharm</a> and <a href="http://www.inkcode.net/qute" title="Qute">Qute</a> but I haven&rsquo;t tried them out.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned earlier, FocusWriter doesn&rsquo;t have support for Markdown but the beauty of the syntax is that it&rsquo;s pretty damn readable even without highlighting. I really like the focus mode in it too and it&rsquo;s cross plattform, meaning that I can use it on any OS that I want to. MarkdownPad was the first markdown editor I used so it has a special place in my heart, as lame as  that might sound. In short, I use FocusWriter for when I write longer pieces of text while I fire up MarkdownPad for shorter things and format checking. This might seem like overkill, but I like to have the opportunity to once in a while use a preview while I&rsquo;m typing something out. </p>

<p>I do think that WriteMonkey looks good too, but I&rsquo;m not too fond of the idea of relying exclusively on keyboard shortcuts. I would probably like mdCharm too, especially since it has a syntax highlightning and the ability to export the Markdown files straight to PDF, which is something MarkdownPad lacks. I might try to use them more extensively at some point.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to start intergrating plain text into your workflow, Markdown is the way to go. The formatting syntax is simple and you&rsquo;re never going to be tied down to one specific tool for your writing. All in all, it&rsquo;s easy to use and it&rsquo;s future proof.</p>

      <p>Yesterday while I was traveling a bit by train I read Paul Miller&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.theverge.com/label/offline" title="Paul Miller's offline series on The Verge">offline series</a> on The Verge about his year without internet. Admittedly I&rsquo;ve previously only skimmed through a couple of the articles, but I decided to catch up on all of them since I had some time to kill during my ride. I think it&rsquo;s an intriguing idea yet at the same time a bit nightmarish. I mean, without an internet connection I wouldn&rsquo;t even have read the articles. I think that a lot of people around my age can all relate to living their lives in some form or another through the internet and I&rsquo;d probably be bored to death if I couldn&rsquo;t use it at all. It might be sad, but it&rsquo;s true nonetheless. The feeling of not being able to have an immediate access to instant information about pretty much anything would be more than overwhelming. I don&rsquo;t know if I should feel bad about it either&hellip; Perhaps not, I guess?</p>
