      <p>A couple of days ago my new hard drive that I bought a mere three weeks ago decided that it was time to make my life not so fun by giving up. For some reason it failed, and it failed hard. Luckily, I had all of my important files (like this whole site) stored on an external drive and I have a SSD where I can keep my OS and all of my programs and such, but some of my other files are forever lost. It sucks, but I&rsquo;ll survive. My brother (who really helped med out) fought like a champ trying to get it to work, but it was a lost cause. In the process of trying to save my new hard drive I also had to wipe my SSD too. It took quite a while to install everything again, but now it&rsquo;s all up and running. The &ldquo;failed to sync branch&rdquo; problem I had earlier with GitHub is also gone, which I guess you could say is good, even though I would&rsquo;ve rather had that problem than going trough this whole ordeal. </p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t really know if I&rsquo;m more sad or more angry though. Sure, it&rsquo;s really important that you take backups of everything that you want to keep and store, but I don&rsquo;t think I really can blame myself entirely in this case. I mean, you don&rsquo;t really except a hard drive that you&rsquo;ve barely used to break down and just fail on you so suddenly. On the other hand I do want to kick myself in the head, atleast just a little bit. Oh well. Sometimes we think that computers are these indestructible things that can do no wrong, but I guess that&rsquo;s not really the case. Now I&rsquo;m keeping my fingers crossed that I can get it replaced without any hassles, but that shouldn&rsquo;t really be a problem. I hope.</p>
