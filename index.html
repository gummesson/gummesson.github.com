      <p>Today I decided to hack together a small plugin for Jekyll that can count all the words in a blog post and also roughly calculate how many seconds it takes to read it. This is based on some quick googling where I found out that the average person reads 300 words per minute, so I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s 100% true but it&rsquo;s a pretty fun feature nonetheless. I&rsquo;ve of course created a repository for it on <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/jekyll-wordcount" title="Jekyll Wordcount on GitHub">GitHub</a>. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure that the implementation I use is the best since it needs to read the content and strip it of it&rsquo;s HTML tags before actually doing the counting but it was by far the easiest way<sup id="fnref:20130131-1"><a href="#fn:20130131-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. The couting seems to be quite accurate too, which is nice.</p>

    <section class="post-content">
      <p>One of the biggest advantages of using a dedicated tool for writing <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> is that they often come with some way of previewing your text file. I kind of miss that kind of function when I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a> I decided to throw together a simple vimscript that uses <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/" title="Pandoc">Pandoc</a> to convert a Markdown file to HTML. The basic gist of it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function! PandocMarkdownPreview()
  silent exec 'cd %:p:h'
  silent exec 'pwd'
  silent exec '!pandoc -o preview.html %'
endfunction
</code></pre>

<p>It sets the directory of the current open file as the root and then calls Pandoc to do the conversion. It&rsquo;s not that terribly complicated but it gets the job done well. I also expanded upon it a bit and added another part that&rsquo;ll open the <code>preview.html</code> directly in the browser:</p>

<pre><code>if has("win32")
  silent exec '!start cmd /c preview.html'
else
  silent exec '!xdg-open preview.html'
endif
</code></pre>

<p>One thing that&rsquo;s worth being mentioned is that the <code>!xdg-open</code> part can be changed to <code>!open</code> and then you can also use it if you&rsquo;re on a Mac.</p>

<p>In the end the whole thing looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>function! PandocMarkdownPreview()
  silent exec 'cd %:p:h'
  silent exec 'pwd'
  silent exec '!pandoc -o preview.html %'
  if has("win32")
    silent exec '!start cmd /c preview.html'
  else
    silent exec '!xdg-open preview.html'
  endif
endfunction
</code></pre>

<p>And the mapping looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>map &lt;leader&gt;pmd :call PandocMarkdownPreview()&lt;cr&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I also threw together more refined version of the whole thing in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/4649514" title="Pandoc Markdown Preview on GitHub">gist on Github</a>. You&rsquo;ll obviously need to have Pandoc install on your machine in order to get it up and running.</p>

      <p>My little <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a> adventure continues and a couple of days ago I uninstalled <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="Sublime Text 2">Sublime Text 2</a>. I have nothing against it and I still think it&rsquo;s a fantastic editor but I feel like I don&rsquo;t really need it anymore. I&rsquo;m no way near being a expert but like I&rsquo;ve stated before I really like using Vim and I don&rsquo;t see that that changing anytime soon. I&rsquo;ve also configured my Vim files <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/vimfiles" title="My Vim files on GitHub">quite a bit</a><sup id="fnref:20130124-1"><a href="#fn:20130124-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I&rsquo;ve tried to stay away from adding too many plugins since I don&rsquo;t want to rely on too many of them. Right now I use eight which I think is a reasonable number. I also finally re-did my git repository so that every plugin is a git submodule<sup id="fnref:20130123-2"><a href="#fn:20130123-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> which makes updating them much, much easier. I have to say that the customization possibilities in Vim are extraordinary. Who knew that that would be the case for an editor that&rsquo;s just slightly younger than me?</p>

<h2 id="a-few-tips-and-tricks">A Few Tips And Tricks</h2>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go through my whole <code>vimrc</code> file since it&rsquo;s currently about 225 lines long <em>(and heavily commented)</em> but I want to share a few handy settings.</p>

<p><strong>Set the language to english:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if has("unix")
  language messages C
else
  language messages en
endif  
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m strange but I tend to stick with using english as my default language in nearly every app I install. I find it to be much easier googling for help. Since I both use Linux and Windows I had to add the <code>if...else...endif</code> part so that it plays nice with both of them<sup id="fnref:20130124-3"><a href="#fn:20130124-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s important to note that this needs to be at the very top of your <code>vimrc</code> file if you want it to work.</p>

<p><strong>Use the cursorline as a mode indicator:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au InsertEnter * set nocursorline
au InsertLeave * set cursorline
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted an easier way to quickly see which mode I was in without relying on some third party plugin. I of course have the <code>showmode</code> setting enabled but by removing the cursorline from insert mode I don&rsquo;t even have to move my eyes one bit. I don&rsquo;t really need to see which line I&rsquo;m on anyway when I&rsquo;m actually typing something.</p>

<p><strong>Autoresize all windows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au VimResized * :wincmd =
</code></pre>

<p>Resizing your windows in Vim can be a bit of a pain, especially if you want to go from using a fullscreen to something smaller or the other way around. The above setting makes it a lot less of a hassle.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore certain files:</strong></p>

<pre><code>set wildignore+=.git
</code></pre>

<p>This was one of the features that I like the most about Sublime Text 2 and I&rsquo;m glad that I can use it in Vim too. If I can&rsquo;t edit a certain filetype I don&rsquo;t want to see it.</p>

      <p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s been up with me lately but I do know that during the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; a lot of things. I mean, most of them are basic things but I&rsquo;ve had fun while doing them. So yesterday I added yet another repo to <a href="https://github.com/gummesson" title="My GitHub account">my GitHub account</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/serve" title="Serve">Serve</a>. <em>Serve</em> is a static site generator which focuses on generating small sites that only need to consist of a few pages at the most.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>It started with an faint idea. I wanted to build something useful that could parse a couple of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> files and convert them to static HTML files. It&rsquo;s no secret that I absolutely adore <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, but I tend to roll with an idea once I get it. I first threw together a one file script that had the same basic functionality and went from there. My goal was to really learn how to use modules and classes since I&rsquo;ve mostly shied away from them<sup id="fnref:20130120-1"><a href="#fn:20130120-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I looked at a lot of different projects on <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> but to be honest I couldn&rsquo;t really comprehend everything, since I&rsquo;m still pretty inexperienced when it comes to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> and programming languages in general. I didn&rsquo;t just want to give up though. I was going to finish my newly started projects goddamnit, even if it would take me months. </p>

<p>It suddenly clicked for me and I <em>finally</em> got &ldquo;it&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:20130120-2"><a href="#fn:20130120-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is such an amazing feeling. It didn&rsquo;t take too long for me to transform the ugly script into it&rsquo;s current state. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s perfect but it looks a hell of a lot nicer then it did when I started and it sort of keeps me excited to continue to learn.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Learning stuff is awesome, especially when you notice your own progress.</p>

      <p>With &ldquo;it&rdquo; I mean how to use them to get them to work with the rest of the code. &ldquo;Inheritance!&rdquo; was literally the thing that popped up in my head that made me understand everything.
