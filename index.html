    <h1><a href="/blog/2012/11/09/footnotes" alt="Footnotes" title="Footnotes">Footnotes</a></h1>
    <p class="small centered italic">Posted on November  9, 2012  in  <a href="/blog/tag/Jekyll" alt="Jekyll" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, <a href="/blog/tag/Markdown" alt="Markdown" title="Markdown">Markdown</a>  </p>
  
    <span class="justified"><p>Earlier today I look into some simple solution to enable support for footnotes since that&rsquo;s something that regular Markdown doesn&rsquo;t cover<sup id="fnref:121109-1"><a href="#fn:121109-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. My current Markdown interpreter, <a href="https://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount" title="rdiscount">rdiscount</a>, sadly doesn&rsquo;t have any support for it but another one called <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/" title="kramdown">kramdown</a> do. I thought that maybe kramdown was going to be significantly slower<sup id="fnref:121109-2"><a href="#fn:121109-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> but it&rsquo;s actually hardly noticeable. According to the <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html" title="kramdown syntax">syntax</a> it processes the markdown a little differently but luckily I haven&rsquo;t noticed any changes, since I was worried for a while that I&rsquo;d had to edit some posts. I did however had to add some thing in my CSS so that the footnotes didn&rsquo;t look to out of place, but since the markup consists of some attribute selectors that didn&rsquo;t turn out to be a big hassle either.</p>

<p>So to wrap this short post up, if you&rsquo;re looking for a pretty fast markdown interpreter for Jekyll that has some additional features you should definitively try out kramdown.</p>

      <p>kramdown is built exclusively with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)" title="Ruby (Programming Language)">Ruby</a> while rdiscount also uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)" title="C (Programming Language)">C</a>, which to my understanding makes the whole process faster.<a href="#fnref:121109-2" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>

    <span class="justified"><p>After trying Squarespace Note for a few days I decided that it wasn&rsquo;t really for me. Even though I feel in love with the interface I couldn&rsquo;t really get over the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t choose another folder other than the app&rsquo;s default to save my notes to in Dropbox. I still think it&rsquo;s a very competent and useful app though, but it’s just not my cup of tea. I decided to look for something else and I did find a worthy replacement: <a href="http://minimaltools.com/" title="Minimal Tools - Pop">Pop</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pop">Pop</h2>

<p>The description from <a href="http://minimaltools.com/" title="Minimal Tools - Pop">the official website</a> describes the purpose of the app perfectly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pop is simply a convenient place for writing things down — that piece of paper you grab to write when you have an idea. It doesn&rsquo;t help you do anything smarter or more organized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that&rsquo;s there&rsquo;s no integration with any other service or app whatsoever. You&rsquo;re only able to write down what you want to keep, and then select it all and copy it to another text editor for further editing and writing. I love that. Note was really similiar to my default text editor, <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/" title="iA Writer">iA Writer</a>, while Pop certainly isn&rsquo;t. I can only use one blank “canvas” to write down my ideas and thoughts. There&rsquo;s nothing to fiddle with. That feels quite refreshing to be honest (I actually wrote the majority of this post in said app). My handwriting is incredibly messy so it&rsquo;s nice to have an app that can quite frankly replace my need for an actual physical notebook. </p>

<p><img src="/images/blog/2012-11-06-pop-for-ios.png" alt="Pop for iOS (with a swedish keyboard)" title="Pop for iOS (with a swedish keyboard)" /></p>

<p>I feel confident that Pop is going to prove itself useful for me. I&rsquo;m absolutely certain that I&rsquo;m going to continue to use it as a springboard for ideas, blog posts and just general thoughts. Just like how it&rsquo;s meant to be used, in my opinion.</p>

    <span class="justified"><p>If you&rsquo;re reading this you should&rsquo;ve noticed that the design once again has changed. I tried to made a promise to myself that I wouldn&rsquo;t fiddle with the site&rsquo;s design for a week but obviously that didn&rsquo;t work out. I did find a rather stunning typeface, <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Tinos" title="Tinos">Tinos</a>, and I decided to run with it while the inspiration was high. I think that it looks so much cleaner now and I&rsquo;ve finally limited my need to change things around on the site. I&rsquo;m confident that this reincarnation of it will stick around much longer than the previous ones (that shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard since I&rsquo;ve had two different designs since the end of August this year).</p>

<p><em>I really need to find a good monthly archives plugin for Jekyll though since the post count is getting too high to work with the current solution which just lists them all, but that&rsquo;s a different story.</em></p>

    <span class="justified"><p>I find it a bit funny that since I posted my last blog post with my little ramble about redesigning I&rsquo;ve fiddled around about ten times with different elements  on this site. Now my goal is to not do it for atleast a couple of days. That shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard I hope. I really do need to clean up the code though&hellip;</p>

    <span class="justified"><p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about yet again redesigning this site. I&rsquo;ve changed quite a few annonyances I&rsquo;ve had since launching the new design back in September but I&rsquo;m still not fully content with it. I guess that&rsquo;s the way it is when you constantly pick up new things from other sites and blogs that you regularly go to. I have a tendency to get extremely tired at looking at the same thing for longer periods of time too. I think that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been tinkering so much with my current design. If I could I&rsquo;d probably change the site every month, but that&rsquo;s an impossible feat since I&rsquo;m not a designer at all. I rarely get by in that department. But still I feel a need to strive for something more aesthetically pleasing. Or maybe I just care too much and should just let it be. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
