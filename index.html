      <p>My little <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a> adventure continues and a couple of days ago I uninstalled <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" title="Sublime Text 2">Sublime Text 2</a>. I have nothing against it and I still think it&rsquo;s a fantastic editor but I feel like I don&rsquo;t really need it anymore. I&rsquo;m no way near being a expert but like I&rsquo;ve stated before I really like using Vim and I don&rsquo;t see that that changing anytime soon. I&rsquo;ve also configured my Vim files <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/vimfiles" title="My Vim files on GitHub">quite a bit</a><sup id="fnref:20130124-1"><a href="#fn:20130124-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> but I&rsquo;ve tried to stay away from adding too many plugins since I don&rsquo;t want to rely on too many of them. Right now I use eight which I think is a reasonable number. I also finally re-did my git repository so that every plugin is a git submodule<sup id="fnref:20130123-2"><a href="#fn:20130123-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> which makes updating them much, much easier. I have to say that the customization possibilities in Vim are extraordinary. Who knew that that would be the case for an editor that&rsquo;s just slightly younger than me?</p>

<h2 id="a-few-tips-and-tricks">A Few Tips And Tricks</h2>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go through my whole <code>vimrc</code> file since it&rsquo;s currently about 225 lines long <em>(and heavily commented)</em> but I want to share a few handy settings.</p>

<p><strong>Set the language to english:</strong></p>

<pre><code>if has("unix")
  language messages C
else
  language messages en
endif  
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;m strange but I tend to stick with using english as my default language in nearly every app I install. I find it to be much easier googling for help. Since I both use Linux and Windows I had to add the <code>if...else...endif</code> part so that it plays nice with both of them<sup id="fnref:20130124-3"><a href="#fn:20130124-3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s important to note that this needs to be at the very top of your <code>vimrc</code> file if you want it to work.</p>

<p><strong>Use the cursorline as a mode indicator:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au InsertEnter * set nocursorline
au InsertLeave * set cursorline
</code></pre>

<p>I wanted an easier way to quickly see which mode I was in without relying on some third party plugin. I of course have the <code>showmode</code> setting enabled but by removing the cursorline from insert mode I don&rsquo;t even have to move my eyes one bit. I don&rsquo;t really need to see which line I&rsquo;m on anyway when I&rsquo;m actually typing something.</p>

<p><strong>Autoresize all windows:</strong></p>

<pre><code>au VimResized * :wincmd =
</code></pre>

<p>Resizing your windows in Vim can be a bit of a pain, especially if you want to go from using a fullscreen to something smaller or the other way around. The above setting makes it a lot less of a hassle.</p>

<p><strong>Ignore certain files:</strong></p>

<pre><code>set wildignore+=.git
</code></pre>

<p>This was one of the features that I like the most about Sublime Text 2 and I&rsquo;m glad that I can use it in Vim too. If I can&rsquo;t edit a certain filetype I don&rsquo;t want to see it.</p>

      <p>I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s been up with me lately but I do know that during the last couple of weeks I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;shipped&rdquo; a lot of things. I mean, most of them are basic things but I&rsquo;ve had fun while doing them. So yesterday I added yet another repo to <a href="https://github.com/gummesson" title="My GitHub account">my GitHub account</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gummesson/serve" title="Serve">Serve</a>. <em>Serve</em> is a static site generator which focuses on generating small sites that only need to consist of a few pages at the most.</p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>It started with an faint idea. I wanted to build something useful that could parse a couple of <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Markdown">Markdown</a> files and convert them to static HTML files. It&rsquo;s no secret that I absolutely adore <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>, but I tend to roll with an idea once I get it. I first threw together a one file script that had the same basic functionality and went from there. My goal was to really learn how to use modules and classes since I&rsquo;ve mostly shied away from them<sup id="fnref:20130120-1"><a href="#fn:20130120-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I looked at a lot of different projects on <a href="https://github.com" title="GitHub">GitHub</a> but to be honest I couldn&rsquo;t really comprehend everything, since I&rsquo;m still pretty inexperienced when it comes to <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/" title="Ruby">Ruby</a> and programming languages in general. I didn&rsquo;t just want to give up though. I was going to finish my newly started projects goddamnit, even if it would take me months. </p>

<p>It suddenly clicked for me and I <em>finally</em> got &ldquo;it&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:20130120-2"><a href="#fn:20130120-2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which is such an amazing feeling. It didn&rsquo;t take too long for me to transform the ugly script into it&rsquo;s current state. I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s perfect but it looks a hell of a lot nicer then it did when I started and it sort of keeps me excited to continue to learn.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Learning stuff is awesome, especially when you notice your own progress.</p>

      <p>With &ldquo;it&rdquo; I mean how to use them to get them to work with the rest of the code. &ldquo;Inheritance!&rdquo; was literally the thing that popped up in my head that made me understand everything.

      <p>My experiments with the <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> framework continues and yesterday I pushed yet another app to <a href="http://www.heroku.com/" title="Heroku">Heroku</a> called <a href="http://slugize.ellengummesson.com/" title="Slugize">Slugize</a>. It only has one small purpose: creating a slug out of a blog title, which can be pretty handy when you use a static site generator like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll">Jekyll</a>. I usually don&rsquo;t decide on a title until a few seconds before I &ldquo;hit publish&rdquo; which means that fixing the slug is usually the last thing I do. I find it extremely annoying that I have to manually type out <code>-</code> between every word in the title and change every letter to be in downcase<sup id="fnref:20130115-1"><a href="#fn:20130115-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. I guess you can call it lazyiness too. Now I only need to copy and paste the title into <em>Slugize</em> and it&rsquo;ll do it automatically for me and I also added an option to append the current day&rsquo;s date to it. It&rsquo;s funny how being lazy sometimes makes you more productive.</p>

      <p>Yesterday I finally pushed something to the master branch of a thing I started working on last week, <a href="#" title="Smallwork">Smallwork</a>. It&rsquo;s a small yet full featured <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" title="SCSS">SCSS</a> framework, or starting point as I&rsquo;d like to call it. The first time I tried SCSS was way back in August or September but I didn&rsquo;t really &ldquo;get&rdquo; it until I started learning Ruby. The code length measures in at a total of 1156 numbers of lines<sup id="fnref:20130112-1"><a href="#fn:20130112-1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> which kind of makes it my most ambitious work to date.</p>

<p>I also played around with <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/" title="Sinatra">Sinatra</a> again and came up with a simple journal app which uses <a href="http://datamapper.org/" title="Datamapper">Datamapper</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" title="SQLite 3">SQLite3</a> for storing everything in a database. Like I mentioned earlier I&rsquo;m quite fond of Sinatra, especially since it&rsquo;s really easy to understand what do to and what&rsquo;s going on. The code is so self-explanatory that I sometimes have to pinch myself to see that I&rsquo;m not in fact dreaming. I&rsquo;m no expert but I like where I&rsquo;m going with it and I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also thinking about extending <a href="http://kramit.ellengummesson.com/" title="Kramit!">Kramit!</a> a bit, but we&rsquo;ll see how that goes&hellip; I guess I should try to slow myself down a bit since I&rsquo;ve launched three new projects this week alone. I&rsquo;m having fun though!</p>

      <p>That&rsquo;s including blank lines and comments. It&rsquo;s still a pretty big number though. The compiled CSS code is 682 lines long and that&rsquo;s without any additional content besides the basic structure itself.<a href="#fnref:20130112-1" rel="reference">&#8617;</a></p>
