Using [Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) in [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) gives
you a powerful way to navigate your code. One thing that I noticed right off the
bat is that it didn't parse and index CSS files, a feature that I'd love to
have. I found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/philix/2657477) that
I modified slightly to fit my needs. I ended up with these lines in my
`~/.ctags` file:

{% highlight text %}
--langdef=css
--langmap=css:.css
--langmap=css:+.scss
--langmap=css:+.sass
--langmap=css:+.styl
--langmap=css:+.less
--regex-css=/^[ \t]*(([A-Za-z0-9_-]+[ \t\n,]+)+)\{/\1/t,tag,tags/
--regex-css=/^[ \t]*#([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/#\1/i,id,ids/
--regex-css=/^[ \t]*\.([A-Za-z0-9_-]+)/.\1/c,class,classes/
{% endhighlight %}

This gives me access to tags, ID's and classes in my CSS files, including
preprocessor languages. To navigate the tags I use
[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim)'s `:CtrlPTag` command, which I have
mapped to `<leader>t`. To generate tags I use another mapping,
`<leader>c`:

{% highlight vim %}
nnoremap <leader>c :silent! !ctags<cr>:redraw!<cr>
{% endhighlight %}

Plugins like [vim-easytags](https://github.com/xolox/vim-easytags) can automate
this process for you. If you need something a bit powerful you could install
[TagBar](https://github.com/majutsushi/tagbar) which allows you to navigate your
tags in a tree-like structure. I have yet found a need to use a dedicated
plugin, but that might change someday.
