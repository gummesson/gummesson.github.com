I've been playing around with using [tape](https://github.com/substack/tape) for
my tests and I've really started to fall in love with it. The default output
ain't that pretty but as the above blog post by [Tom
MacWright](http://www.macwright.org/) points out all you have to do is pipe it
to some other formatter. Thanks to another one of
[substack](http://substack.net/)'s projects,
[tap-parser](https://github.com/substack/tap-parser), I've actually written two:
[tap-min](https://github.com/gummesson/tap-min) and
[tap-json](https://github.com/gummesson/tap-json). There's also
[tap-spec](https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-spec) and
[tap-dot](https://github.com/scottcorgan/tap-dot), both by [Scott
Corgan](https://github.com/scottcorgan), which I really like too.
