For the last couple of weeks I've been learning about the
[Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) pattern, mostly by
playing around with [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux). It describes itself
as a "predictable state container" and here's my short review of it: it's really
cool.

My impression is that nearly all Flux implementations are tightly coupled to
[React](https://github.com/facebook/react). With Redux it feels like I can use
it with pretty much any JavaScript framework or library. This is a big win for
me.[^20151227-1]

The creator of Redux, [Dan Abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov), have
released a free video course called "[Getting Started with
Redux](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux)" which is the
perfect starting point for understanding how it works and its benefits. I highly
recommend it, even if you're already familiar with Redux.

[^20151227-1]: I like React but I love modularity.
