I just released a new "side project" called [Bucket](http://ellengummesson.com/bucket/) that I threw together earlier today. It's just a small [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/) site where I plan to start collecting and sharing links which I find useful or interesting. It's something I've been wanting to create for a while but haven't really had the time for until recently.

The source code is of course [available on GitHub](https://github.com/gummesson/bucket).
