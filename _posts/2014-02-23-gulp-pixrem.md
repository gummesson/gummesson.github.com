I found [node-pixrem](https://github.com/robwierzbowski/node-pixrem) (which
automatically adds pixel fallbacks to rem values in your stylesheets) a few
weeks back and I've been eagerly waiting for someone to turn it into
a [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) plugin. As luck would have it, no one ever did so
earlier today I decided to do it myself. A couple of minutes later I had
a [working version](https://github.com/gummesson/gulp-pixrem) up and running.
