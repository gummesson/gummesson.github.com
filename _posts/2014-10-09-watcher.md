It's been a while since I released something new. This time around I wrote
a tiny thing called [Watcher](https://github.com/gummesson/watcher), which'll
execute command whenever the file system changes. I didn't even bother to
publish it on [npm](https://npmjs.org/) since it's totally tailored towards me.
You can easily enough install it by running the following:

{% highlight text %}
npm install --global gummesson/watcher
{% endhighlight %}

It's mostly useful when you don't need a fully fledged build system but want to
run an arbitrary command. It should work well enough on all operating systems,
although I haven't tested it on a Mac yet.
