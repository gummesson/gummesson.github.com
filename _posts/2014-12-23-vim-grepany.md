I've used [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) for code searching on
and off since I started using [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). It's an awesome
plugin, but I want one that isn't tied to a specific tool. I decided to write
[grepany](https://github.com/gummesson/vim-grepany) which automatically finds
the fastest tool available for the job. Pull requests are always welcomed!
