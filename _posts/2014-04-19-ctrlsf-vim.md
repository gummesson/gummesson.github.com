I stumbled across this plugin in a thread on the [Vim
subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) and it's pretty fantastic. I used to
use [ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim) and it seems that I had the
same problem as the plugin author, namely that I wanted more context when it
came to doing searches.
