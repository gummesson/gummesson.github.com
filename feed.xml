					<title>WordPress to GetSimple to Jekyll</title>
					<description>&lt;p&gt;... Or: &quot;How I learned to stop worrying and love the command line&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love WordPress. I think it's a really great CMS and the community is huge, to say the least. However, I feel that it's sometimes a bit too much. If I wanted to have a site with a lot of pages and if I was writing several blog posts a day it would been a no-brainer, and I'd choose it in a heartbeat. But since I don't plan to do that I wanted something smaller. I've been playing around with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.get-simple.info/&quot; title=&quot;GetSimple CMS&quot;&gt;GetSimple&lt;/a&gt; (which is a small but powerful CMS that stores everything in XML files) for a while, so at first I decided to use that. However, it isn't really a blogging plattform so I had to install a  plugin for that. It worked alright, but I still didn't feel quite satisfied. Then I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is described like this in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll Wiki on GitHub&quot;&gt;official wiki&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory (representing the raw form of a website), runs it through Textile or Markdown and Liquid converters, and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Jekyll takes your template files (written in HTML and/or &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot; title=&quot;Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and marked with &lt;a href=&quot;http://liquidmarkup.org/&quot; title=&quot;Liquid tags&quot;&gt;Liquid tags&lt;/a&gt; and generates them into simple, static .html files. &quot;Blogging Like a Hacker&quot; is sort of Jekyll's tagline, and I think that's a really good description of it. You have to use the command line to generate your static pages and you basically have to write your posts and pages in Markdown or Textile (I don't see that as a bad thing at all though, I love to do it that way). You can also use plugins to extend its' functionality. For example, I use one that enables the pagination pages to be generated into different folders called &lt;code&gt;/page/2/&lt;/code&gt; and so on (rather than &lt;code&gt;/page2/&lt;/code&gt;), and another one to create folders and .html files for my tags (I'll write more about this in another post).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's incredibly lightweight. It doesn't need a database or any back end language like PHP at all, which means that you don't have to worry about the database breaking and you can host it wherever you want to. The file size of a site which consists of just static pages is ridiciously small too (this whole site takes up about 200 kb as of right now) and above all, it's highly customizable. One big thing that actually irks me about WordPress is that it's filled with many pre-named classes and functions that you can't change. Well, you could go into the source and hammer away there, but I'd rather not do that. With Jekyll I can actually change the look of the site in a matter of minutes and I can easily add a new class wherever I want if I need to. It only generates the things that I've added by myself. The only disadvantage is that I need to sit in front of my computer in order for me to use Jekyll. It doesn't really matter to me, since I've never been comfortable with writing and publish post with my phone or via email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said in my previous post, it took me some time to actually get it up and running, but now I'm finally happy. It's not the most convenient solution, but it's simple enough for me. I'll probably write a couple of more post about Jekyll, so keep an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;

					<title>Hello World!</title>
					<description>&lt;p&gt;So, launch day has finally arrived. This site has been a work in progress for the last couple of weeks and I'm now finally happy, or atleast content, with how it looks. It's been a kind of troublesome yet quite fun ride (it took me some time to learn my ways around &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and all of its' functions and bits and pieces, but now I'm all set, I think).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Behind the scenes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don't really know what to write in this post I thought I could write about how I built it and what tools I've used during the process. After all, my tagline contains the word &quot;geekiness&quot;. Enjoy it, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ellengummesson.com/&quot; title=&quot;ellengummesson.com&quot;&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; is powered by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jekyllrb.com/&quot; title=&quot;Jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; and hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot; title=&quot;GitHub Pages&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. It was built with HTML5 and CSS3 and my own grid system, &lt;a href=&quot;/projects/begrider&quot;&gt;Begrider&lt;/a&gt;. The code was written by hand in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot; title=&quot;SublimeText 2&quot;&gt;SublimeText 2&lt;/a&gt; with the theme &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/&quot; title=&quot;Soda Dark&quot;&gt;Soda Dark&lt;/a&gt;, the color scheme &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme&quot; title=&quot;Tomorrow Theme&quot;&gt;Tomorrow Theme&lt;/a&gt; and the plugins &lt;a href=&quot;http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/alignment/&quot; title=&quot;Alignment&quot;&gt;Alignment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/prefixr&quot; title=&quot;Prefixr&quot;&gt;Prefixr&lt;/a&gt;. The site uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Cabin&quot; title=&quot;Cabin&quot;&gt;Cabin&lt;/a&gt; for the headings and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Vollkorn&quot; title=&quot;Vollkorn&quot;&gt;Vollkorn&lt;/a&gt; for nearly all the other types of type. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono&quot; title=&quot;Ubuntu Mono&quot;&gt;Ubuntu Mono&lt;/a&gt; is used for the code blocks. They're provided by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/webfonts&quot; title=&quot;Google Webfonts&quot;&gt;Google Webfonts&lt;/a&gt;. The blog posts (and pages) are written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot; title=&quot;Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.markdownpad.com/&quot; title=&quot;MarkdownPad&quot;&gt;MarkdownPad&lt;/a&gt;. I occasionally use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.iawriter.com/&quot; title=&quot;iA Writer&quot;&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt; too, just to mix things up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That sums it up pretty nicely, and thus, the link bombing ends here.&lt;/p&gt;
